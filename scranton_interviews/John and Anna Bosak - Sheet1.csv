B. And then what did you have to do?
"J. Well, I worked on the farm. And my brother insisted that I come to this country. I was 17. The teachers and the priest recommended to send me to some school because I was best scholar in the class. And I hardly stayed in the school because I knew my lessons all the time."
B. Why didn't you go on did you decide to come to America.
J. They suggested that I be sent to get higher education. And in the meantime my brother was already in America.
B. Why did your brother go to America?

to go somewhere.
B. So he wanted to take a better life for himself. Where was your brother Mike when
he told you to come to America?
"J. He was already in Olyphant. The mines were good here, the immigrants would get"
jobs at times the mines were poor but he heard through a Jewish peddler that there was jobs here.
B. When you were in Europe did you see any at advertisements about coming to America. Did some agents or steamships promise you that it would be better to come over here?
"J. Oh yes, there was lots of them."
"V. Before you came to America, the people that some came back from America how did they describe it?"
"J. They described the country that it was Heaven, and when I came here I was sorta disappointed."
V. What did you think America would be like?
"J. Heaven. At time I had such a good time in Europe, that my older brother went into the army and he left me to take his place. In the youth circle, I played the accordion in this little group and I had a good time. And when I came here I couldn't understand wha going on here. In Europe I was a prima donna."

V. Where did you stay when you came to Olyphant?
J. With my brother.
V. And what was your first job?
"J. The first job was to wash the horses and clean the bottles, because I was waiting to go to school. So I had to attend to school here at night, in Olyphant. To learn English, and then I was sorta disappointed so I enlisted in the Army. And I didn't like my job, because I was promised to be sent to college, in the first place I had to attend to the horses, so it wasn't what I expected. there was no transportation, no movies, nothing like that to do. Then I went into the mines and in our district we had about 14 families in our yard. And there was a labor job in the mines - and if I don't like this kind of job, well. I went down and I didn't like it either. Because the miners would drill the coal and maybe they would have enough for a couple of weeks, and then they might not even report to work and the laborers had to do all the rest of the work. The more cars you loaded the more pay you got."
"V. What was your next job then, was it in the mines?"
"J. Well, there was a clerk in this business. My brother had steamship agents, and he had wholesale liquor, and a delivery man. And I had to be in with them. So my brother was busy here and there and he took me down to the recruiting place to join the army but they wouldn't take me because I couldn't speak English. I was only about a year here. So I told them I wanted to be in the cavalry And my brother tried to get me out of it. But I wanted to learn english. I served in the army for 3 years."
V. When you came out what did you do?
"J. Well I spoke pretty good english then, So I traveled a bit and went to California But I was really devastated living here, I had been here and hadn't heard a Slovak world."
V. So you came back here after.
"J. Yea, well I went out to California."
V. What did you do in California?
"J. Well, I didu labor work. They were developing Hollywood then and they needed men to"
"build. Things were cheap and just to knock around was fun. And it was easy to keep a room, and so forth. And I look for a job, in the Hollywood sets and everything had to be done by had. And no matter where you came from they would give you a job. And it was pretty good pay. And we had to drive the mules."
V. What made you come back to this area?
"J. Well, my brother said that I should come back, because he needed men here and not only that I was his brother."
"V, What ports did they leave from in Europe?"
"J. They left from _____Germany, Hamburg, ________Rotterdamn in Holland, and places like that. They didn't like to go to Charlsburg places like in England. A Lot of times there was so many agencies that people would get lost trying to get to the right place And we used to have to go with them to help them, to get them to New York so they get on the right boat. And sometimes they were left because there was no room on the boat"
V. Did you take care of them when they came back from to America?
"J. Sometimes, we would collect the pay from the guy that life he would sign a paper saying that we could pick it up and then we would mail it to him."

"B. Yes, but was the differences in the two lodges was it also reflected in the two communities?"
"A.B. Just simply divided, to whatever leader they wished to follow."

"A.B. Yes, they mostly stuck together."
B. Did the Slovak miners and the Slovak people experience any discrimination when they first came here.
"A.B. Yes, very much. Well, in the period of 1881 when my father was in Freeland, and he"
"came here. My mother used to tell me that when it was time to go to work they would start gathering on their porch to go to work in a group. Because they were afraid they would be attacked by someone. But when they traveled in a group they felt protected. And my father was a big strong man, and he was given a team of 4 mules and he was develope the ground around the breaker. And he was paid a $1.60, because it was hard work. And they all stayed there because they thought he was a big strong man and they would be protected. In 1888 there was still trouble. The people didn't want the new immigrants coming in and taking their jobs. And it soon became a sport to hurt these people. And they would detour the people so they wouldn't have a fight.a and this one day they stayed and had a fight and that mk was the end of it."
B. Did they call them names?
"A.B. Oh yes, Hunkey and a lot of other things."
B. Did the same thing happen to the Polish people too?
"A.B. Well, I think that it didn't made any difference because they would all bunch them together and call them anything they wanted. They were all Slavs."
"B. Some of this division that came out from the Polish and Irish, a came out when Polish left the Irish National Catholic church, in Scranton. Do that have any effect between the Slovaks, was there any friction between the Slovaks and the Irish?"
"A.B. The Polish always took a stronger stand, although all these groups wanted their own churches, and they worked very hard to get it. In Olyphant has several Greek Catholic churches, and an Irish church, and a Slovak church. And they had the Irish nuns to teach the children the catazism. And they worked very hard to have a church,"
B. When the polish broke away you didn't see that the Slovak were or wasted to do the same thing? Did they suppress it?
"A.B A very aggressive Polish priest wanted to know wh·∫°y they were being treated this way, why the Irish had all the power."
B. Did the Slovaks want to know that?
"A.B. The Slovaks were quite contented, they weren't quite as rebellious. Although"
"after the first World War they came from Slovakia and they tried to organize an independent church. And they only succeeded in two places in McKeesport and in Binghamton, New York."
B. did they come to Olyphant?
"A.B. I don't think so. If they did, it was not very well known. Our people were very loyal to their Slovak churches."
B. Did you say that you grew up in Freeland?
"A.B. No I was never to Freeland. My people came to Olyphant in 1888, And I was born in 1890. And that was when our church was first finished. And I was christened there. But before you had to go to the Irish church to be christened."
B. When you were growing up in Olyphant did you live in a boarding house?
"A.B. No, my people started to build there own home. And they lived in their own home when I was born. They barely found a place to live when they came here. After 30 years of mine work my father decided to buy a farm and they lived there for 6 years and then came back down town and lived in the city. And then during the first world war they bought another farm to keep the boys out of the service, but then one finally did go in."
B. Did you go to work as a young girl?
"A.B. No there was p≈Çenty of work to do at home. I learned dressmaking, and you had to work 6 months as an apprentise. There were no factories for women, there were silk mills."
B. Was there one in Olyphant?
"A.B. Yes, there was. Silk mills were popular then because there was no other work for women there is now."
"B. Would you say that the majority of the (Slovak) girls 15, 16, 17 did these girls go into the silk mills?"
"A.B. They went in as early as 12. And the family needed the money. They didn't put as much stress on education as work. So that they would send them to the silk mills. And the boys went to the breaker, and picked slate. And my father got a piece of coal in his eye and he couldn't work and with all the family what were they gonna do they gave the workers no compensation, but the company said that they would give his son a job so he went in and worked he was only 10 years did, but it was a question of bread.
