J.S. Yes I went to school in Troop.
A.V. What year did you start working in the mines?
"J.S. It must have been in 1912 or 1913, because I quit in 4th grade and I worked and then I went back to school and then from school I went back to work and I've been working ever since."

A.V. And as you got older did you change jobs?
"J.S. I worked there, and I filled the oil lamps and they used not have electricity at that time and I used to fill the oil lamps, light them and stick them in the beams then. They had to have light in the breaker. And at that time they had steam and they didn't have any electricity, and they had those screens, that used to be as long as this room and each one had a different size hole, and they used to dump the car of coal and it would go down different shutes, and then they go down in the pickers and we used to have a slate, well we used to adjust and the rock would stop and then it would slide on that and it would go down on the rock pile, and then the coal would go fight over it and then we'd pick it out. The bigger coal like stove coal, egg coal, and grade coal."

A.V. What was the most dangerous job in the mines that you ever had or say anybody?
"J.S. Well, the most dangerous in when you are in a hurry, and they don't test the roof or something like that. Mostly it was like they load their car in a hurry and forget what's above, and that's the main part that the union bosses said to protect yourself from. And during a hurry, they were finished. I've seen them sit down, and fellas eating - and all hell fell down and cut them up right there. I've seen a fellas that his just came back from the war for one day and some thing go wrong and see his leg's cut off right there. And I used to laugh at these big fat guys that they would see the blood and faint right there. I've seen guys on this mechanical loader, he had his foot wrapped around this rope and when they would pull it, the scoop that would go out would cut his leg right off. It was bandaged there and everybody was running around there scared. Well, I've done a lot of first aid training there too. Now, since I've quit I don't do nothing."
"A.V. What were your hours, when did you go to work in the morning and come home at night? J.S. I worked in the mines, it was all hours."
A.V. Do you know anything about the coal and iron police?
"J.S. No, the Molly MacGuires yea, but not the coal and iron police. My daddy belonged to the Molly MacGuires when he first came here. But me I never belonged to no organization."
A.V. Did the people around here consider the unions important?
"J.S. Yes, they did."
A.V. Were the unions already set up when you got here?
"J.S. No, the unions just started when I was here. I even collected union dues, but at that time they didn't have the checkoff. The checkoff, the company used to take care of the checkoff. Now you used to pay your union dues to the company. The company took it out and gave it to the union. Before you had to pay it out of your own pocket. Well, they used to travel a lot of trouble and they had to change it and that's how they changed that."
"A.V. Did you work with other groups besides you said that you were lithuanian, were there others?"
"J.S. Sure, I worked with Italian, Polish, Lithuanian, I even worked with some blacks in the mines."
A.V. Did you think that there were any groups that weren't nice to you?
"J.S. No, they were all, that one thing is in the mines you are all friends, in the morning, I'll sit down and talk about different things, and then the boss would come around and say that's its time to go to work, and that would be that, we'd go to or champers."
A.V. What was your boss like was he a nice guy?
"J.S. Well, I had a couple of bosses. They are all dead now. They were all nice to me."
A.V. They got along with all the miners and everything?

A.V. Was immigration incouraged when you were working in the mines? Did you ever notice how they tried to get more immigrants over here?

A.V. What were the company towns like?
"J.S. Well, there was the richmond breaker right here where my house is, there was the Reshmand butcher and Johaston breaker it was right over here on the main street. Right where the highway marker is. And the where the Troop breaker used to be, the lokie used to come up that way from the main street. Well they used to bring the coal up here this way. And that's how these houses were built. So they tore the breaker down and built these houses here."
"A.V. Was it difficult to get a job around here, at that time."
"J.S. no it was easy. And one thing when the people used to go to work around here they'd say good morning, and now they pass by and don't say nothing. They think that you're trying to take something away from them. I used to go to work and my dad used to carry me in a pale, because I was too small. They walked to work."
A.V. Where did you shop when you first worked in the mines?
"J.S. In the store. The company store, there was one in Troop, and there was one in Dickson right there, by the soda company. That burned down and the one in troop burned down. Different places they had different company stores."
"A.V. Could you describe your neighborhood? Like what the houses were like and like what the people did. What you did on Holidays, what you did for fun."
"J.S. During the week off the people used to get together and one would bring chicken and one would bring meat, and then somebody would say that's good then I'll have a party. And I'll bring the beer. We used to get a big pail full of beer and they used to enjoy themselves on a saturday, when a neighbor had a pig and they wanted to slaughter the pig they would all get together and killed the pig and it was like a party and then they all shared up with it. Chickens and ducks they raised chickens and ducks, and when I was small I used to watch when my mother and father used to kill geese and that well, they used to make from the feathers pillows, and they used to take the feathers and place them in a pillow. And today I don't know its different, its that foam. A.V. Who lived in your house, was gest your family? Or did you have boarders?"
"J.S. Yea, my mother used to have boarders, I used to scrub this white brattish, every morning A.V. How many boarders did you used to have?"
J.8. 4.
A.V. Did you have a yard around your house? A garden?
"J.S. Yes, we had a yard, and a garden, we used to plant lots of tomatoes. At that time I don't think they knew much about carrots and that you know like today. We had chickens and ducks. Today you can't have them. We used to have a lot of pigs, and cows. And we used to take the milk and dump it in the cans."
"A.V. Did any peddlers ever come through your neighborhood, selling vegetables, or something J.S. Not only vegetables, but the Shammie used to come and they used to blow the horn and if you couldn't give him money you used to trade like if you had rags. You'd give that to him and he'd have pots or something and you'd do that instead of money. It was bartering. And the fella used to come with the meats in the wagon, and you used to buy what you wanted. Same thing with ice. A lot them used to make there own ice boxes, and keep the ice that way. That was back in the horse and buggy days."

A.V. How far down did you have to go; to get into the mines?
"J.S. They have like this is the top bein and then yaugo down and then they have another vein and theres about 4 or 5 different veins. The top vein had a different name, each vein. Like in the olden days we used to go in a slope but then they got those carriages, and we used to get on a cage and go down, and in the slope you could go down to any vein you wanted to; because they had those drifts, and airways and that's how they used to go to work. But coming out climbing the hill like that that used to take the breath from you. If there was a fire in the mines there was a lot to of fumes, when you come outside you hit the air and it used to be too much you breathe to much and you'd have to sit down and take it a easy. When you would go home they used to take a drink of whiskey, well I used to go for a walk in the woods when I used to come home. And you'd get a awful headache from the fumes in the mines. And the dust, the sulphur..... lots of times you'd be working in and there would be one chamber there and one chamber there, them fellas fire and when you're' down there you get all their smoke; and they used to have little fans........ but you had to wait for the fans to work and still the fumes were in the coal, after you fir and then you breathe all that stuff and then you're' mixing all that when your shoveling, well that's different. Now in Jaloopy they used to have a chain on it and they used to bring the coal out and then dump it in the cars. And the shaker you always had to be there to top the cars off. And that's what the union always wanted, big topping."
A.V. Did the people have local saloons around here that they could go to?
"J.S. Yea, they had them."
"A,V. Did you ever have many fights in them?"
"J.S. No, that's one thing that they didn't have any fights. Like today you go and get into an argument and then you go fighting. Well that's one thing that I don't believe in if you want to go and have a drink that's good but no fights. But today you get too hot headed. People have guns and knives. Best policy keep quiet."

A.V. Was it hard trying to live in this country? At home you had to live your parents ways and at school you had to live that way.
