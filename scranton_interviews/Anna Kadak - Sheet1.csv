A.V. Could you tell me alittle bit about the why your parents left Europe and came to America?
"A.K. Everyone was leaving Europe and coming to America and my father was the only son. So he danced in that famous hall in Vienna, and was chosen for being the athlete of the county, he was an athlete. And he could ride any kind of borse. My father was Enell Hurban, and my mother was Anna Hurban. And his father owned one side of the Slovak Moravia shore, and they raised sweet beats for sugar and for spring they would come and plant the beets, and in the fall they would dig it up. They lived in a house that was 500 hundred years old, an old stone house. All I remember there were two brothers, so these two people were quite well to do. And then my fathers' mother passed away, and in Europe you work with your father, and then when you get a step-mother you feel you are an outcast. So he felt terrible, and wanted to come to America."
A.V. Did your father marry your mother in Europe?
"A.K. Oh, yes. They lived there awhile."
A.V. What year did they come over here?

A.V. Why did your mother decide to organize that particular organisation?
"A.K. Well, first of all my mother believed in organization. She came from that kind of family. They were all dignitaries. But my mother wanted to have an convention and there were only 8 or 9 women and none of them could read or write english. My mother was very active in the czeck church too."

"A.K. Well, there were really a lot of fights and a lot of the organizations don't want to admit it..........................."
A.V. What were the requirements to belong to the organization?
"A.K. Just to be Slovak. They founded it to help the widows, and they also founded it to help themen. The men would get a hundred dollars, when the wife died. It was sort of like an insurance agency. The people were poor when they came from Europe, there were times that were so hard in Cleveland. But nobody was hungry in Cleveland. The city took care of everybody."
A.V. How did you get over here? How did you get to Scranton?
