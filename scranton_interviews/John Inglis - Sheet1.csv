E. - John L. Earl - interviewer
"I. - Mr. John Inglis - interviewee Scots 3rd generation, Supervisor of mines"
"E. Today we are interviewing Mr. John Inglis of Waverly Pennsylvania. Who is presently retired, but has been active in mining in the Moffit coal company or the Glen Alden coal company, and the state bureau of mines, in several positions. His father William Inglis was president of the Glen Alden coal company. In the 1920 Could you tell us a few things about your father, and could you tell us how the Glen Alden coal company evolved?"
"I. Well, my father first started out with the Pa. Coal company. And then he went with the Delaware and Lacklwanna coal company. In 1921, the Glen Alden company was formed and they took over the DL&W railroad company. And my father was the general manager. And then he became the president of the company. My whole life has been involved with the coal mining industry. I recall even on Sunday we would go out to the collieries and check them out. Coal has been all of his life and so has it been all of mine."
I. Could you tell us how you began in the coal companies?
"E. After I left college, I was with # brokerage firm in New York city. The depression came along and I was laid off. I then went to the sales dept. of the DL&W company in New York and got a job there. From there I had some experience in the retail business. Then I had a chance to come beck to Scranton with the Moffitt company in 1934, I was assigned to the Pine Taylor coal company, which was formerly one of the Glen Alden coal properties. For 10 years I was inside the mines 6 days a week."
E. Can you give us some Ided what was the demand of coal? And a felationship to the other materials on the market.
I. The 1930's the coal had an active market. In Mass. coke was a serious competitor. I can still remember going out and demonstrating coal. Instead of coke.
E. What was the difference?
"I. Coke wasnot as expensive as coal, but it was dirter. I can't recall the prices."
E. Did you have any competition with oil and datural gas?
"I. No. Oil was comming in, but no natural gas."
E. Could you give us some idea why the DL&W broke up?
I. I think there was some anti trust problems there. But I can't seem to recall the separation.
E. The Glen Alden company was a separate entity.
"I. The Glen Alden was still the Glen Alden until 1930. But then there was a change in corporation and then it was the Glen Alden COMISKY, the Blue coal corporation. Moffitt took over all the Glen Alden properties in Lackawanna County."
E. What caused that change?
I. They felt that it was a better ideal for the stock holders.
E. Were there any labor problems at the Glen Alden?
"I. There could have been problems. With a new company stepping in, it was easier to establish mining rates."
E. Can you give me some idea what the cost of mining labor increased?
"I. The primary reason why we used coal was the competition of gas and oil. It was cheap, but the people wanted less work in tending fires etc, so they looked for a better way. At the same time all costs were rising. And then pumping water from! the mines was too expensive, and the water filled the mines ßo no more coal could be mined."
"E. With the present problem of conservation, do you invision a comeback of coal in the future?"
"I. That's hard to say, I think that it would be prohibitive in cost, now that the mines are filled with water. Just to get the coal out. I can't see it, but maybe in the future. But the cost of pumping is tremendous. and I doubt that the money be available. And if they used coal again the same convenience problem would come up about cleaning and heating."
E. Could you give me some idea some of the other positions that you had with the coal industry?
"I. Well, my first job was in the mines checking the large section of the taylor mines. Labor was plentiful in those days and men were always looking for work. The miner in the mines was making $5.14 dollars a day and the laborer was making $5.01 a day. And that is quite a difference from today."
E. What kind of standard of living did you have on 30 dollars a week?
"I. Well, they seemed to live well enough. It was certainly a far cry from the days with the boys used to work for the breaker for 3¢ an hour. And that was about 10 hours a day."
E. Where were you educated?
"I. I went to a grammar school here and a went to a high school here and then I went away to Borough Academy for four years and then from there I went to the Williams College and then spent a year at the Harvard school, and then going to work."
"E. You mentioned that you were working for the stock company in New York, did you have any plans, or was it just fate that brought you back to the Scranton region?"
"I. I didn't have any plans, and I was happy to work there, but when conditions became such that I needed work, when the opportunity opened up at the Moffitt coal company I took it."
"E. Your work at the Moffitt coal company, did you become friends with the miners, do you have any little stories that you could tell us about the people that you worked with?"
"I. I can't say that I had any personal relationships, they were had working men. And if a man has spent time in the mines, he could almost get a job anywhere. They are good workers."
"E. At the time yere you conscious that they were immigrants, did you have any feelings towards these people working there with you?"
"I. No not particularly, most of our men were Slavic or Italian. And all good workmen."
E. Do you know any efforts that were made by the coal companies to incourage immigration from the Slavic and Europeans land. To come over and work in the mines?
"I. Not some of the mines, there was one company that advertised in the paper to get men to come over and work in the mines. How successful they were I don't know. But they were searching out all ways to get men."
"E. How about a company town, were they in existence when you were there?"
"I. No that was before my time really. At the pine colliery, there was a place called the pine patch, and in prior years it had housed the workmen that worked in the mine. By the time I got there they were sold and gone."
E. What kind of neighborhood was it where you lived and grew up?
I. I lived in the city of Scranton.
E. Was you city a gettho?
"I. I wouldn't say that my neighborhood was, I know that many of our neighbors were in some phase of the coal industry. But there were parts of Scranton that were ghettos."
E. Where in Scranton did you live?
I. In the Hill district. On vine street.
E. Can you remember any of your neighboors or friends? Did you have much in common?
I. No my association with friends of my own age was limited. Until I came back to Scranton.
E. Do you remember the home that you lived in?
"I. Well, we had quite a moving life so to speak. My father built a house for about 15 years wwe lived there. And then every winter, ....... We lived in Scranton in about 7 different houses, until we bought a house there. We had a great amount of mobility."
E. Do you have anything to say about the street that you lived on or the churches or the people?
"I. I don't think that I can help you much for that matter. But my grandfather had a store on Lackawanna ave, it was a furniture company. And of course my father was a great church gower. And going to church was like getting up to go to breakfast."
E. Was the church an important part of your social life?
I. My father and mother got more out of it. We always had grace at meals and no bible readings.
E. What kinds of foods did you eat?
"I. My mother was an excellent cook. I cant'r remember, that's a little hard to answer she was a good gook, but for awhile we had a cook and mother would always supervise the preparation of the foods."
"E. How about the preservation of foods, how did you keep them?"
I. We had an icebox. And then we had a refrigerator later on.
"E. Getting back to working in the mines, was there any child labor þpoblems in the mine"
"I. No there was no such problems, that was before my time."
"E. How about the unions, and labor disputes?"
"I. Well, the union was very strong. And although the Moffitt coal company's labor problems were few the industry itself was beset by serious problems from time to time. Father also had the job of chairman of the conciliation board. And if there was a new contract that was suppose to come up he would have to go and meet with John Lewis that was the union leader. And as you know Mr. Lewis was a dominant fighting man."
E. How did the two of them get along?
I. They got along very well one of the very few men that Mr. Lewis respected.
E. Does you father talk about this?
"I. Well, the reason that my father liked Mr. Lewis was because he always kept his word. If he said something he did it. It was sorta of a mutual admiration society."
E. Did your father think that the demands of the union was a little excessive? The reason possibly that contributed to the financial plight of the coal mine?
"I. I think he did, I think he felt that way, but ehwould fight for what he thought was right, and if it didn't come out that way well there was nothing much he could do."
E. How about advancement at the mines? Did you yourself give and receive promotions?
"I.Yes, I would say so, after spending 10 years inside the mines Mr. Moffitt gave me a job of a safety director of all the mines which was 9. And in addition to that job I was given a job as the personel (director) plus a purchasing agent."
E. How about men that worked in the mines? Was there a pattern of time or how did they advance by themselves?
"I.Lets say that the man starts in the mines and is a fire boss and after some time of experience in that position, and given some time we would make him as section foreman. And a section foreman you could step up and do a mine foreman's job. And above that is the superintendent. And many times when men would jump from one to another there would only be two positions in the entire mines."
E. Do you recall what their nationalities were?
"I. Well, we had a polish mine foreman, and english superintendent, and an Italian superintendent. And some Irish and Welsh. Some were supervisory capacity, and some were workers."
E.Do you remember any strikes when you were working with the company?
"I. We would feel it as everybody else, but there was no strike that was just us."
E. Were you unionized?
"I. No, we were not."
E. You mentioned that as a youngster you moved a lot. But can you remember any society or fraternal organizations that you were a party of? In Scranton.
"I. No, I don't think so. I belonged to certain societies but removed from my work."
E. How about your father?
"I. Well he was a mason and he belonged to the societies, the common ones, nothing that would be controlled by the industries lets say."
"E. Can you remember in your youth, can you remember any of the newspapers and if they were fair to the mining industry?"
"I. I would say that they were fair, the Scranton Times and the Tribune. Would print the news as they saw it."
E. Do you have any recollections of the importance or the impact of the change when the county changed from £ republican to a democrat?
"I. No, I don't think so. There was no significance."
E. How about the... do you remember any predijuce or discrimination that you suffered because of your nationality?
"I. No, no nasty things."
E.Did you know it for other ethnic groups?
"I. Well, I think that there was a certain amount of injustice. It's done everyday. It is true then as it is now."
"E. Could you give me an assessment of the Scranton area and how it has changed? Coal is no longer king, what do you think coal has done to the region?"
"I.I think that Scranton has made a tremendous recovery, and although Scranton owes its origin to the mining of coal and when that was no longer feasible they entices other industries into the region. I often hear many comments derogatory about the coal business in its early years. But if it hadn't been for coal Scranton probably wouldn't be here."
"E. How about the people that lived there, they didn't think anything derogatory about this area, they were proud of it right?"
"I.Yes, right. That's correct, people were making good money."
E. Do you think that there was some selfishness on the part of the coal mining industries?
I.Probably some of these things that were done to the mines could have been changed. If a little more thought had gone into it.
E. People said that the railroads contråled the mines and tries to make money off the mines. What do you think of that?
I.I don't thảnk that is quite right. I think that hindsight is better than foresight. Probably if different methods had been used we might have avoided some of these things. But I suppose that the men thought they were doing the right thing.
"E. Do you invision a good future, without coal?"
"I. I think so, certainly it has proven itself so far."
E. Would you encourage the young people to stay here?
"I. Yes, I would. There are plenty of opportunities. Grass isn't always greener."
E. Can you think of anything else you would like to say.
"I. I think that the whole picture of coal mining was good from beginning to end, I just thånk that maybe there would have been a better use for coal - and it could have been developed. I think that we would still have been mining coal today. I think that the anthracite was used primarily used for homes, in heating. If there had been another use I think that the picture would have been different. But efforts have been made over the years to find some other way, but that has been very little."
E. How about to generate electricity?
I. Some of the utilities use some of the anthracite but that is a small portion of the market.
