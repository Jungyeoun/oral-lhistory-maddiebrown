And I aiad well, that I was going to make a break before I was 50. So I quit down there and I came home. So a friend of mine in the New Jersey office of the Curtiss-Wright company, so he asked me if I wanted to go out, and I want, to the interviewed and he sent me to different places and have pictures taken and then I had to sell myself to the bosses. At Curtis-Wright. So I want up to see this foreman, and told him what I was looking for and that I was thinking about going out as a 1st class electrician. And he asked if I had any experience, and I said yea, so he said O.K. and gave me the paper to go back, and I was hired. I din't know where I was going to stay, and the guy that was with me didn't get a job. So he said that if I would take him over to Mr. Clair that he could take the bus. Well, I thought where I was going to go. So I called this man in Mt. Clair that I had known, and I said that I could stay with them. So I went in and stayed for supper and the night. Well I stayed that night, and I didn't know how to get to the plant. Because it was foggy, ante the guy took me out to the plant, and then next day I found it ok and the next day I said that I had to find a place to live, and the first thing that I thought about was to go to a priest, and he took me around to all the places to all his members to see if they had any room for me to stay at. And he stuck with me until I found a place. With a very nice lady, and I was there for 20 years, I thought I was going to be there for the duration of the war. But I stayed there for 20 years and I was forced to retire, when I was 68. When I came back here when 1961, I still I owned the place. But in the meantime I built a beautiful home down in Jersey. I was working on the midnight shift. I only worked 6 hours and I was paid for 8. Because it was a different shift. And that was the best job that I ever had. And then I got on the grievance committee. And I was on that committee, and then that was a seniority job. So I lived there and had a nice time, but I am getting ahead of hy story....."
