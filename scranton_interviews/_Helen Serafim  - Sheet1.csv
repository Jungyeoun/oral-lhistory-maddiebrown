A. - Angela Vauter - interviewer
S. - Mrs. Helen Serafin - interviewee Polish

"A.This is an interview with Mrs. Serafim, she is a second generation Pole. Mrs. Serafim could you tell me anything about your parents mentioning about Eruope or what it was like?"
"S. In Europe unfortunately they came from an area that was occupied by the Russians at that time. So their freedom was very very small. If you served in the army it had to be theirs, and it had to be for the Czar. And particularly it was bad because the Polish are very religious people, and when they went to mass they would have to sing the opening song to the Czar, who was then ruling. And they were always resentful. They also lived near a camp, and my father used to tell us about the abuse from officers. This officer would remove his gauntlet, and it would have a buckle and he would slach this gauntlet across the face of some poor person. So my father actually escaped. The name of it was Filophefif. This was in the area that still the Russians occupy. So they came here."
A. Do you remember what year they came here?
"S. I was born in 1901, and I was the first little girl they had; they had lost 2 others at birth. I don't remember when they came, it would be in the late 1800’s."
A. Did they ever mention how they came to this area?
"S. Yes, my father came. There was a brother in law and a sister in law here, living. And they sent the passage, so we had to pay for it. And he worked for the mines and paid it off. And they traveled for about 3 or 4 weeks, and then she got very sick, and they had to send her back to a German port, and he had a hard time getting started. But he finally made it. My father was here about 2 years, And my father was 38 years old when he was killed in the mines. He was a typical father, he learned to write his name, and he was very proud. His teachings were very simple. They were limited, but they were beautiful."
A. Did he know any english?
S. No.
A. They always spoke to you in Polish?
S. Yes.
A. Did you speak back to them in Polish or in English?
"S. Well, mostly in Polish but later in English. We had a good life, we were poor but it was a good life."
A. did your parents rent their house?
"S. When my father was killed in the mines, my mother had six children and the oldest was 18 years of age. She said she had 400 hundred dollars left from the lodge, after she paid for the priest and for the grave. ( He belonged to a fraternal organization, and it was affiliated with the church).."
A. What other social things that the church sponsored did you have?
"S. Well it was mostly with the lodges, the rosery mothers and so on."
A. Did they have dances?
"S. Maybe not every night but they used to have them. Sometimes they would have a big ball once a year. And the priest would stay the entire time, until the Amen. Add the orchestra wouldn't be Benny Goodman, it would be someone that could play the fiddle, or the achourian,, or someone that could play the clarinet. And if we got 3 people to play this was a great thing. It would be held in the ……. To the church. We looked forward to that because the entire family would go. And maybe you would get the soda treat, and imagine getting a bottle of soda, we must have talked about it for weeks. And there was a curfew at 9:00."
A. What kind of games did you play?
"S. Bedlam was one, Hooper was another. We would touch one another, and you would be within a specific square. And you have to make that, and if you missed, well. Everybody knew everybody, and when the new people came in they would try to move in next door to someone that knew america, and what they were doing. People have extreme respect for America. Anybody that had a relative, and marriages where hard because you were limited to the number of people you met. You didn't have any transportation. At different times they would have different things to do, for the seasons. Shucking corn, killing a pig or ducks, or a cow for the winter. They would have a bundle of fun in their own way. Sometimes things were self taught, it was hard, they used to hide the books when they lived in Poland, to keep it from the Russian soldiers. Sometimes they used to make their violins, and flutes, they were very good. Poland was noted for the lakes, and the hunting and the fishing it was a very beautiful place to live. They had protein in all the fish and they were always healthy. Salt was plentiful. It was good."
"A. When you lived in old Forge, was that basically a Polish neighborhood?"
S. Predominantly.
A. Each ethnic group sorta lived with itself?
"S. Yes, and sometimes they would mix beautifully. They were always neighborly. The friendship was there, even to the point that all races came in. In the main part of Old Forge, where we moved, there were quite a lot of Italians, and they had an easier access for school. In Europe you mixed with your own kind, the mixed marriages started here. I'm very happy to see Polio beaten. I hope to live to see something beat cancer."
"A. When you were young and you lived with your mother, did you have boarders?"
"S. No. Because her children came rather fast and there were only 2 little rooms. And then we had 3 rooms later,"
A. Could you describe your house?
"S. I thought we were rather lucky, because i was told that the house I was born in"
"they weren't able to buy a stove, they didn't have the money. And the stores weren't there to buy from."
A. Was there a company store?
"S. Oh yes, that was our store, it was very important to us. You had to buy from there if you worked for a particular coal company, once a month or they would say something to you about it. We had quite a few Welsh people move into the mines because of the mines, they have a fabulous knowledge of mines – because of the mines in Wales they were good miners. I think they became the bosses right away first of all because they didn't have the language barrier, and second they were so good with the mines. This was how my father was killed drilling a hole by hand. They had these drills that you had to turn into the rock to drill, They had very very crude methods of drilling. And as he drilled he disturbed the coal and both he and his laborer were killed because of the falling of the roof."
A. How did they brigg your father home?
"S. It was terrible, they brought him in a black buggy with two black mules and just brought the body in and put it down. When my father was killed they brought him into the front room that also served as a bedroom, etc. They brought him in the buggy that we called the Black Mairia, they are really black. And they just brought his body on a stretcher, and put him on the floor and they left. And we had very good neighbors, and they all helped. It was awful that these people had to face this in their lives. And here the Italians began to mix more. They had two lodges then and each one had a 500 hundred dollar policy, there was 400 dollars left, and my mother said to my oldest brother, I want you to go looking for a house. And my mother said that to be sure it had a garden. He hunted and he found a house that had 8 rooms. Imagine 6 children moving into an 8 room house, from a 3 room house. And I remember going to the first mass after we were there, and I wanted everybody to know that we lived in an 8 room house, and had a bedroom of our own, imagine! So I thought she did very well for an illiterate woman, and my father was proud, when he could sign his name. We lived there until the family grew up and moved away."
A. Did you go to school at a Polish school? The church's school?
"S. Yes, under the church, I went to Polish school from September to December, when the the boiler broke and that was the end of my Polish learning. So then I went to Sussex Street School after that and it was nice. It was a public school."
A. Did you ever feel any prejudice when you went to these schools?
"S. No. I think once in a while you run into it. There were alot of different people. Everyone had their own churches. And you went and sang in the choir, and there again you needed choir practices, and that was another social event getting together and practicing. But then you had to be in the mines by 6. And you worked 10 hours."
A. How did your mother support you after your father died?
"S. Well my two older brothers, they didn't go to high school. My fathers death greatly effected our lives, even when I got married. And when World War I came, my husband had to go. And the tragedy of a war is very bad. And the oldest boy got a job, but I don't remember where. And the next brother worked in the nines, and he did until he went to the war. So my younger brother always liked watches, and he makes lovely watches. When my mother died she was 74. And she was always Ma."
A. Would you tell me something about your customs?
"S. They were just beautiful. My son in law starts talking about the Vigil supper in Ocotber. And to this day we don't eat any meat. This was for Christmas eve. We tried to always be home for that. But it's very festive, and we used to play Christmas carols, and sing."
A. What were some of the foods?
"S. The foods were wonderful, you started out with poppy seed, and that would be in the bread. You had to eat a little bit of everything, and then have some fruit. And we had rice and fish was a must. And no matter what nationality you were everyone liked Pierogi, with cottage cheese and all kinds of fillings. We had a variety all the time. And fish. After the Christmas songs we went to church. And no matter how poor you were, you had something."
"(A vest amount of explanation of customs, etc. is left out in this Transcript )"
"S. The older people were illiterate but they were always genta. They never yelled. They were always quiet. And Easter was very beautiful too, it wasn't as happy it was sadder but it was beautiful too. You went to church, which was very solemn. Even then we had a lot."
A. What about some customs at St. Gladiolus? (?)
"S. Oh, that was beautiful too, I wouldn't think of going to church without your parents' kissing you, both parents."
Change to the other side of tape........
A. How did you meet your husband?
"S. Well, I knew håñ just about all our lives, we went to the same parish. And we were from the same neighborhood. He was an organist in our church. He was an adult when I was just a child, but later on it was a different story. I'm only sorry that I only had him for 25 years, because he died in 49, at age 52. We were richer, we were poor but never hungry. Everybody took in boarders, because they needed the money. These men had separate books and if they bought a pound of meat and they didn't eat it all, then your family got the rest of it. My mother didn't because we didn't have the space, and there were alot of children. My husband too, he was wonderful. He was a newspaper man, my husband was one of the first to help translate Polish papers into English."
"A. When you were young, maybe you didn't notice, but when the strike went between the Polish people and they had the Polish National church, did that have any cause for defeat?"
"S. Yes, it did, but not where we lived."
A. Was there any public transportation there when you were young?
"S. Yes, there was there was street cars. We had wagons, any transportation you could get. But mostly it was the street cars. And it was a nickel."
A. Were there any local bars or saloons around where you lived?
"S. Oh yes, everytown had a bar or someplace to go. I used to go after my father sometimes he used to stay and have one extra drink. Every bar used to have a pretzel barrel. And they would be filled with huge pretzels and I used to love to go after my father and then get some pretzels."
A. When you were young and before you got married did you work outside of the home?
"S. Yes, I worked in the store."
A. Was it typical for most of the girls to work outside of the home before they got married?
"S. Well, I was lucky. I think that they had to work if the family needed money. The silk mills were very popular."
A. Were there newspapers?
"S. Yes, one a month and this was all we had. And the people who had relatives over there in Poland or someplace always had some news."
A. Do you still have any ties with the people or some relatives in your old country?
"S. I went to visit a family, I wanted to see it, but the Germans and Russians had it occupied again like Before. They had a cow and some chiæckens, it was nice."
A. You mentioned that in Poland the people had cow and chickens and pigs and other animals. Did you have animals around there?
"S. Oh yes, we had a lot of animals. Now we didn't, but my mother used to have pig. We would salt the pig and have them for later. They were very careful to salt the pig they didn't want anyone to get hurt from the pig. If it wasn't made right."
