not verbatim
"J.E. Today we're interviewing Mr. Parroccini, at 506 Keystone Street, in Peckville. Mr. Parraccini was born in Gubbio Italy. He is first generation. He came to the U.S. around May 15th, 1911 entering in New York. Mr. Parroccini can you remember what it was like to live in Gubio, Italy? What kind of a village was it, was it a farming area."
"J.P. Well, it was a farming area, of course in them days there was only a few industry - like cement....."
"J.E. Where is Gubic?, is it in the southern central....."
J.P. It's in the center of Italy. It's east of Rome. In the Province of Umbria. It's mostly in the center of Italy.
"J.E. And you say there was some industry there, cement?"
"J.P. There was little industry, just some cement as I recall. And there was some mill they used to make bricks, and tile for the roof."
J.E. Was there much farming?
"J.P. Almost all or was farming, wine, and different products of the farming business. Raising cattle....."
"J.E. What was your father, what did he do?"
"J.P. My father, he was in the line of farming, and also cattle.. buy and sell and take care of the farm. Now over there, the farm itself very few farmer owned their own land. But one guy maybe own three or four farms and the supervisor take care of everything they needed for the farm buying different tools, different stuff for the animals, and things like that. But he would do some on that line too."
J.E. Did you travel much while you were over there?
"J.P. No, we didn't travel much, around those other small towns."
J.E. What was your home like?
"J.P. Well it was nice, nice buildings. We lived right next to the church. We were outside the city. Gubio was a city. And we lived outside the city. In the farming section, maybe few from the city."
J.E. Did you develop any skills? What did you do there as a boy?
"J.P. Well when I was a young boy, I worked, on the farm, and besides I worked many times as a brick layer with the masons - like a helper. Lotta times my father would have a mill to make bricks and tile. Lotta times I worked around there. When I was big enough."
J.E. Can you remember any parties or customs? Festivals? What did you used to _________ like that?
"J.P. Oh yes, right in the parish we used to have 3 or 4 days that were special, and the people used to get together. And of course it was something like when they used to give those picnics. They used to get together, the guy who would sell wine, they would sell liquor and fruit. And cook different foods, and we used to have party like that. It used to happen 3 or 4 different times in the year. People used to get together like on Sunday and they would bunch up, play different games and have a really good time among themselves on Sunday especially."
J.E. How about the reasons why you left Italy. Any reasons why you came alone? Not your mother and father - did they stay in Italy for the rest of their lives?
J.P. Yes.
J.E. Any sisters or brothers?
"J.P. No, no sisters or brothers, I have a brother and a sister over there. I come here with my brother-in-law. My brother-in-law was here, and he came back to Italy and married my sister. And then he served in the army for 2 years, and then he came back over here. He asked my father if help him out let me come over here. He said he would get him a job. He said he believed that I would like to come over, so my brother-in-law asked me if I would like to come over here. Lot people used to leave Italy then and come over here - work a couple of years and then come back. So I told him I'd be glad to come, so my brother-in-law was my sponsor because I was under age. I had to have somebody to take care of me to over there. So I come over with him."
J.E. So you had the intention of coming over for a few years and going back.
"J.P. But you know what happens when your in a place so long and things change. I got up into my twenties, and we got a notice include Country of going to register for the service."
"That was usually what you'd do. You'd go to register pass a physical test, if they were in physical condition they'd take you for the army, 2, 3, 4, years."
J.E. That was WW I.
"J.P. When my brother took him into the army, and I had an idea to go back. So I went to the consul here in Sctanton. If you don't go back and serve your country, you'll never be able to go back again. So I went down to the consul with intentions to go back, Lotta other friends of mine had gone back. They were really sorry they had gone back. So when I find that out I said if they call me here, I go here. So I didn't go back. Mean time I lost my mother and I got married, and never went back until 1968, I went back with my wife."
"J.E. During this time when you were here, did you make any steps to become an American citizen?"
"J.P. Oh yes, and I got my papers. It took a long time about 3 years. You get the paper, that is what I did in 1917; I got my citizen paper....."
J.E. Were you taken in the American Army?
"J.P. No I wasn't because I was miner. The miners in the First World War, were considered like they were in the service. I guess they needed a call and that's the only thing that they had here. You were to fill out what they called questionaris, and then you bring that to the superintendent of the colliery. Well if you were a good producer a good worker, the superintendent would sign it and say I need this man. And naturally you'll find someone that's not always in good humor, whether miner or laborer, and naturally the superintendent won't sign the questionnaire. And they used to take them in the service."
J.E. Before you came to the U.S. did you know anything about America?
J.P. Well the only thing I know was about this mine working. And nothing else
J.E. Who did you find this out from?
"J.P. Well, from the different people that came back from here."
J.E. So you had contact with people who had been to America and had come back to Italy. So you knew a little bit about America.
"J.P. I knew a little bit about America, from the people who were working, in the mines. They were going down in the mines, in the elevator. My poor mother, when she heard that from a friend of hers, she don't want me to come here, because you know how the old timers used to be when they were over here. In America this fella used to be here and he came back, and my mother asked him how was it in America. How was the work. He said the work, oh, they send you down with the ropes, into the mines and the lights if your light goes out you'd be in the dark. So she don't want me to come."
"J.E. How did you pay for the trip, was it expensive to come?"
"J.P. I pay for the trip, for the ticket $43.00. But in them days that was a lot of money."
"J.E. How did you make the money, did you borrow it..... ?"
"J.P. My father had the money, for me for the fare."
J.E. Do you remember the trip?
"J.P. Yes, it was pretty rough. It took us from the 25th of April, and we got here around the 15th of May. We leave from Gubbio, and we got on the train in Gubbio, and we come through Bologna and France, Toulon. The ships name was Britania, it was an English ship. And it left from France."
J.E. Do you have any rememberances any little stories about the trip across?
"J.P. When we came over here, this is a story about my brother-in-law. He was suppose to be my guardian, but he was in the service in Italy. But, in the meantime he was glad to come over. His division was recalled. . Because they were going to have a war with Libya. So he came over without his papers, and he could speak French and German. And when we got on the ship, he told me you stay with them - ""I'll see you on the ship."" And then on the following day he came around, on the ship. And he slept with me all the way through. (steerage). He slept on the top, I slept on the bottom. And then he was working on the ship - ""when we got into New York you get off and stay with these men. And I'll see you on the steam boat."" So when we went through the checkers, where they check you, I was kinda afraid, because I didn't know the other guys so well, and I was afraid I'd miss my brother-in-law. So after we got on the steam boat then he came, and we came across. But nine days on the boat I couldn't eat nothing, I was sick as anything, all I could do was drink a little beer. And then when I got here I was here for a week and I was sick from the ocean."
J.E. Did you bring your own food for the trip?
"J.P. No, we used to get it on the ship. They used to serve it to you. Because the ship in them days was pretty rough. Storm in' the ocean the ship, my god....."
J.E. Did you have a room on the ship? A private room?
"J.P. Well, the men they all were in like a big hall. And ladies in different compartments."
J.E. What was your first impression of New York when you saw it?
"J.P. Well, It really didn't impress me too much because I already heard of it. The main thing when I saw the Statue of Liberty, I knew I had arrived. It was really something when you were that young, everything really impressed you. Because one thing in them days young people didn't travel that much. Especially when you were in a farming country. But later on it will come."
J.E. Did you come directly to the Scranton area with your brother-in-law?
"J.P. Yes, right to Scranton."
J.E. Was it because your brother-in-law had a job here?
"J.P. Well he had a job when he first came, and then I got a job too."
J.E. Did he get you the job?
"J.P. No, See when we came he stopped in Peckville, because I had some relatives here. And he went up to Eynon. That's were he used to be here before. So he was going to take me up there. But my cousin told me you stay here and I'll get you a job. And I'll take you to the mines for a couple of days and you'll see the mines. And then a friend of my family, find out that I was here and he said that you come to work with me. He said if your father know that you come to the same town that I am and I not take you to work with me your father would be mad at me, because they were great friends. So I went to work with him his name was Lipprie, Napieto Lipprie, from Jessup. His sons are Steve and Jessie. And I worked for him quite awhile."
J.E. Was he a miner?
J.P. He was a miner.
J.E. Did you become his laborer?
J.P. I become his laborer.
J.E. So he took you as his laborer. Where did you live during this time?
"J.P. I board with my cousin, and several other boarders. In Jessup."
J.E. What kind of a neighborhood was it? Was it an Italian neighborhood? or Was there other nationalities there?
"J.P. There was all kinds of people there. There was Italian, Poland, English Irish. I was on the low part of Jessup, then we move up on the top part of Jessup. There was mostly Italian and Irish and pure Polish people or other pure English people, but mostly were Italian and Irish."
"J.E. Can you remember the house a little bit, was it a nice house?"
"J.P. Well, it wasn't a bad home but it wasn't what we have today. There was no carpets. There was no rocking chare. There was no couch. Just common wooden chairs, and I remember once, there was a great big table, and benches on each side of the table, and a great big kitchen."
J.E.This was a boarding house then wasn't it??
"J.P. It wasn't what you'd call a regular boarding house. A man and a wife they used to take boarders in. Imagine we were about 12 boarders and there was this man had his father and his mother. They were old. And himself there were two children and his wife, in six room house. It was really crowded of course, when you were young you didn't mind it. And six room house the boarders used to keep the upstairs and the family the downstairs. But it wasn't really crowded.. J.E. How was the food? Was the food she served very good?"
"J.P. The food was good, of course you can't find as many things as you find today. You go to the store and you can buy anything. You can buy your whole dinner. But in them days all you could buy was meat, bread, flour, and not much of the sweet stuff."
"J.E. Was it basically one-pot meals, stews and such?"
"J.P. Well, like home made stuff. Like home-made soup home-made macaroni."
J.E. Was it an Italian type family? Did she serve basically Italian type food? Did she have a garden? Was there a church in the area?
"J.P. Yes, there was a church in Jessup, we lived in Jessup a long time. And in those days I don't think people went to church like they do today. Because when you come from my country,' when your young you kind of last from things like that. But later on......"
J.E. This wasn't an Italian church was it?
"J.P. Yes, it was an Italian church."
J.E. A Catholic church. Did they say the sermons in Italian? Read the Gospel in Italian?
"J.P. Yes, yes."
"J.E. How about school, I guess you were too old to go to school. How about peddlers?"
"J.P. Oh yes. In them days there used to be a lot of peddlers, peddling clothes, and fruit, and most of the peddlers were selling clothes."
J.E. Did you but their clothes?
"J.P. Oh, yes, a lot of the time."
J.E. How about transportation? How did you get around? Did you walk?
"J.P. Walk, walk to work, when we go to Scranton we. ride the streetcar, or train. or any other time it was just walking."
J.E. What did you do for amusement? Games or Sports?
"J.P. Yes, the Italian game was bocce-ball. That was the main sport that we used to have. And we used to have to throw bocce. Not the regular big one but a smaller one and we used to throw them up Mossic Lake road. Up that way. And now we throw you have a bocce and I have one and who threw it farther. Its something like golf, but we'd throw by hand, we had no sticks. That was our main game, like on Sunday, after work during the evening, during the summertime."
J.E. Did you play anything like baseball or soccer?
"J.P. I didn't but we used to. And that game was soccer, baseball, those were the main sports years ago."
"J.E. Did you go on picnics, things like that?"
"J.P. Oh yea, a lot of picnics. The mines used to hold picnics every year. And then for about a week, there was a picnic ground. There used to be all kinds of games on those picnics; bicycle races... Lotta times we used to have big rocks and fellas would try to see who drilled the hole through first. Everything, on the lines of the mines. Somebody, cutting timbers, who would, quicker better way. And it really was enjoyment, because the people used to be together. It wasn't like today, there was no cars to go anywhere. There was no television to look at, radio to listen to.."
J.E. Do you have any special remembrances of the holidays? Any days that you celebrated particularly in the United States?
"J.P. Well, I remember the Irish Church, used to have what was called then as You go to Lake Lador, every year on the train. There was something special like for this area here. And like on Sunday we used to go watch the lake, and that was the main place because I lived in Jessup. And we used to walk to Mossic Lake: And somebody used to go up there on the street car, becuase it was a streetcar between Dunmore to go to Mossic Lake."
J.E. How long of a walk was it?
"J.P. To Mossic Lake from Jessup was about, ž hour or more, 3/4 of an hour. A good walk."
J.E. Did you go to any of the taverns or saloons?
"J.P. Oh yes, see in them days each gang would have its own place to go.. .Either because you were friends with the saloon keeper, or you just started to go there. And you go there after work and play a little game of cards, and have a beer. And a lot of the time, they'd have pool rooms and you'd go play a game of pool, have yourself a drink, and most of the time I was never much of a drinker. And that was enjoyment. Because after work there was nothing else to, do. You don't go riding because you don't have no automobile. And you just sit around among friends, and tell them stories, and play different games, cards, bocce....."
J.E. Were most of your friends Italian?
"J.P. Well yes at first, but later on there was all kinds."
"J.E. Did you have difficulty, you didn't speak English when you came."
J.P. No
J.E. Did it take you awhile to learn the language?
"J.P. Well it took awhile, I mean what I did learn was a hard way because you had to pick it up at work or among friends. You know when your young you can't speak, you always mix in with the young people. You go to different picnics, they used to have picnics, they used to have dances, right on the ground. A couple of boyfriends would introduce you to a girlfriend. It's a hard way to learn, but its the only way you can pick it up."
J.E. How did you meet your wife?
"J.P. Well my wife I met her in Jessup. We used to go around, her father used to have a beer garden, in Jessup, and we used to go there. Then I begin to know her, and I know her family. That's the way I met her in 1922. Well of course I knew them way before that. But that's when we started to go together. And then that's when we got married in 1922. ."
"J.E. You had been boarding up until then,right?"
J.P. Yes.
J.E. Then you went into your own home? Did you rent a home or what?
"J.P. For awhile we stayed with her sister, but then we went on our own in Jessup. And later on we moved to Peckville, and then back to Jessup for awhile, and then in, well I forget the year, but we moved back to Peckville - and here we are."
"J.E. How many years did you work in the mines? J.P. I started as a laborer, in 1911 and I quit in 1959. Forty-eight years in the mines."
"J.E. You started as a laborer, and you loaded cars, for a friend of your fathers How long did you do that?"
J.P. I worked for him about a couple of years. And then I got my own job mining; I became my own miner.
"J.E. Was this with the same mining company, or did you move from mining company to mining company?"
"J.P. Oh, I worked with different companies, of course, not with too many mining companies. I worked for the Marjes Spatol Company. I started work there. Then I worked with the Temple Coal Company, in Surry Creek Colliery. Then in 1929 I worked with Underwood Colliery, owned by the Pennsylvania Coal Company. And I was there till the company closed down. And after when the company closed down, a new company came in and they used to call it the Realty Coal company. I worked with them for about 7 years. Until I retired as a miner."
J.E. How did you find the work? How was it to be a miner? What were some of the things that you did as a miner.
"J.P. Well in the mines you got to do everything, especially today. Of course, up around here we don't have many mines anymore. But, before the miner was in such a way they used to cut the coal drill their own holes and charge it and blast them. Cutting off the coal for the laborers, and some of the miners when they had enough coal they would go home. They leave the laborer alone with the coal. And laborer job was to load the coal and clean the rock that was around the coal. But that was it, of course you had to timber your place if you needed it. But then when the machinery came out, on the mechanical order: shaker shoot different loaders, then they used to have the airline for the jackhammer. You had to put that in yourself. Then you had to have your line for the engine go by electricity. You had to put that wire up yourself. And you had to keep everything in order, your fireline. Years ago they didn't use no fireline to blast out the coal. You used what they call ""squibes"". See we used to drill with a hand machine, and load our coals and put our “squibes"" in and light it, with a lamp or a piece of paper. But then later on when new law came, we had to use batteries to fire our holes, and we had to have a line an electric wire to do that. And we had to take care of everything that way. When the engine broke down, not all the time but most of the time, we had to do the repair. Of course, they had a regular guy to do that. But you'd loose so much time, and you'd have to go do it yourself. But it wasn't only that you had to blast the coal but there was a lot of other things you had to do to. You had to help build the platform that bring the coal in on the cars. There was a lot of work to it."
J.E. Did you ever think that it was' dangerous work to you?
"J.P. Yes, but once you get used to it, you don't think about that. Of course, there is always danger. Especially in the mines, especially if you have a bad roof. You got to be careful, because a lot of times that's when the accident happens. Some carelessness. But I was lucky."
J.E. Were you ever injured in the mines?
"J.P. I was injured once, not too much. Otherwise, I was lucky. Because after I became miner, I had a liver (problem??), and in my old time none. of my body was hurt. I was hurt, a small rock on the roof. But it wasn't much, but you know when a rock hit you it hurts."
"J.E. What was you income like, did you make a reasonable amount of income?"
"J.P. Well I'll tell you, people say, they were good all day, and I guess when your young you are good all day. But we say in them days things were cheep. But there was no money around to buy toses things. Well, my pay when I started then was $1.92 a day. And that was considered pretty good money. Because it was called company work. About 11.00 dollars a week. Work six days."
J.E. How many hours a day did you work?
"J.P. When I first started it was 10 hours, and then it came down to 8 hours a day. But even when it was 8 hours, in 1912, you had 54 days strike. And I had just come here in 1911. And that's when 8 hours started. But work was kind of slow. And men wouldn't come out until they get the hours. So they used to put in 9 sometimes 10 hours up until it was late in the evening. But then we got the 7 hours a day and that wasn't bad."
"J.E. How about child labor, do you remember any children working in the mines?"
"J.P. The kids used to come in there, as a knippen, they used to call them. Door tender, we used to have a door in different spots to circulate the air. So they used to have those boys, and they were supposed to be 13 years old, but some of them were 8, 9, or 10 years old. And they stay there when the mine cars come out. They were supposed to open the door and when car go by they were supposed to close the door. And then after that they used to get a job called 'leading the mules.' And when they learned that they used to get a job of driving the mules. And then they used to graduate that and get a job at running the cars, what they used to call a runner. You used to get up to a place that way steep, where the cars would come out. Well they used to have 'sprags' like a piece of wood. And when this car came out, they used to sprag them, put them under the wheels. They used to sprag the car according to how fast it was going. If they know the car would make it they wouldn't put no sprags in it. But if they know that the car would go by there then they would sprag it, put the wood, so it would stop. Later on the motor came out, and there wasn't much of this spragging, running business."
J.E. How about the Unions? Do you remember much about the Union? Do you think they made the working conditions any better?
"J.P. Oh, yea they did especially at first. Naturally they made, later on some kind of a record. Because years ago there was no help if you get hurt. There was no compensation, nothing. And a lot of time you'd do a lot of work, and they wouldn't pay you. And again it was the Union that got really strong. The men would work in better conditions. And safety conditions especially, and better pay."
J.E. Do you remember any strikes? Did you have any strikes?
"J.P. Yea, we had a strike, maybe 2 or 3 big strikes. The first one I was in 1912. 54 days; then I believe we had one in 1916. And then we had one in 1920 and then we had another one in 1926. And those strides were a couple of months every one of them. Long strikes."
J.E. How did you make out?
"J.P. I don't know, still a lot of times you go back there you go strike for six months no income. And still we would buy, naturally in them days it. used to be a grocery store that used to take care of the men, as long as the strike. When you work, it took a long time to pay it off. J.E. Did everybody pay it off?"
"J.P. Well, some of the men didn't. The store keeper got stuck. Maybe sometime they move away. They never come back, and they would forget about it."
J.E. How about during the strike? Did you work elsewhere?
J.P. No there was no jobs. That's all it was just a mine.
J.E. Was there any violence that you remember?
"J.P. There was a couple of violence, when those strides were on. Those men they come out and demonstrated and a lot of times the cops would come out and the sheriff would come out. I don't remember but I heard early in the 1902 there was quite a lot of violence."
"J.E. But you don't remember any violence, disruption of property, people getting hurt?"
J.P. No not here.
J.E. Was there the coal and iron police when you first came here? Do you remember them? Did the coal companies have their own police?
"J.P. Yea, they had their own police. But the most I remember was the Savanna Coal Company, police. They ride on horse. But some of the company had police, if you cause any trouble on their property they'd take you in."
J.E. Were they ever mean or nasty or unfair do you think?
"J.P. No, in some spots, but up around here I didn't hear too much about that. The only trouble that was here, was they came out and wanted a new union. They wanted the coal miners to have their own union, to get away from the soft coal, and get away from the United Mine Workers. And"
"they call the new union ""United Miners of Anthracite."" But they fought Balonia and Capolinia and that gang there, but all the miners didn't come out. See that was the time they had the trouble up here with the Raymond Colliery up here. They were all out and the sheriff came out and they quited everything down. And the company cops were there."
"J.E. How about the foreman and the supervisor, were they tough people to work there."
"J.P. Well some of them, but most of them the foreman were alright."
J.E. Were they Italian or were they different nationality?
"J.P. Well, most of them were Welsh, and English, Irish, and a few Italians, Polish. And of course, I remember, most of them were English and Irish, Welsh. And especially the colliery that I worked in over in Jessup. I worked there quite a while. There were Jones and Roberts, and Morgan."
J.E. Were you ever involved in politics?
J.P. No not much. (except for voting.)
J.E. Did you retain any ties with the homeland? Do you still write with the people in the homeland?
"J.P. Yes, I have a brother, and a sister. They are the family now. I correspond now. In fact, I wait for an answer from my brother right now."
J.E. And how many children did you and your wife have?
J.P. Two. A boy and a girl.
J.E. The boy did he go into mining?
"J.P. No, he wanted to go, but I wouldn't let him. He went into the service in 1942, and then he was out. He was in the Air Force, and he was out, about 3 or 4 years, and he went back in again. He make a career out of the service. He was there about 22 1/2 years. And then he came out, while he was in there he was a recruiter in Pittsburgh. For about 12 more years. Then he come out a few years ago, and he got job over there in Pittsburgh. That's where he is now. J.E. How about your daughter? Does she still live in the area?"
"J.P. Yes, she lives in Scranton. South Scranton."
"J.E. Do you remember any conflict? Any bad things happen between you and different nationalities, maybe a fight or something?"
"J.P. Well, years ago and sometime really you had to watch out, going out during the night. Different nationality might attack you. But I never had any trouble. But I've seen trouble."
J.E. Do you think anytime you lived here in the U.S. did you personally suffered any prejudice because you were Italian? People nasty to you at times?
"J.P. Well, kidding our men a lot of times when we used to work in the mines, a guy would come out with a phoney word. And they just be kidding, but sometime somebody meant it, and they would call you names. And otherwise I never had any trouble..... After your family grow up you don't have very much trouble with different nationalities. Especially today."
J.E. Were you happy you left Italy and came to America? Has your life been good here?
"J.P. Well, I don't know I suppose, over here there are much different conditions because over there, there was much work in those days. But I believe I did the right thing. But for some of them who were left there those of my age, they still make out good, of course they went through hard times, during those wars. For that I thank God we were here."
J.E. Did you loose any friends during the First World War?
"J.P. I lost a nephew. First World War I lost a couple of friends, over there but during the 2nd world war I lost a nephew. My sisters son. And a couple of others that were injured but they came out all right."
"J.E. Is there anything I've left out that you would like to add, anything that you would like to add? Have we pretty well covered it?"
"J.P. Well, yes. When we started out we had the oil lamp, and then from that, we had the carloine lamp, and then, we had the battery lamp."
"J.E. Were those lamps hard to tote around? The batteries they were heavy weren't they? You had to strap, them to you didn't you? ."
"J.P. Yes, you kept the battery on your belt."
J.E. Was that the only light you had when you were down there? The light rom the battery? (lamps).
"J.P. Yes, no other light. There might be lights right near the shaft, in the box office. But not on rope or in the chamber. Them days when we had the oil lamp and they used to have clap, you could put the lamp on it. Boy, that lamp made you sweat all day long. Then when the Darby lamp came along it was a little bit better. The battery came we thought because it was heavy it was a clumsy thing to use. Once you hooked them on your belt."
J.E. Were there any cave-ins? or explosions? When you were in the mines?
"J.P. Oh, yes; a lot of times when I worked in the Mt. Jessup colliery, it used to be a lot of gas in there, and I happened to be there but I wasn't hurt. But other men were hurt, and some carelessness when the motor came on the spark, lit the gas, and I remember 3 or 4 different explosions and the guys at work were hurt bad. Once even the fire boss was killed in an explosion. And I remember once, there was a cave-in and 5 men were caught in there. There were two miners and two laborers and the foreman. The roof started to shake so bad that the foreman knew that he had 4 men inside, and he said that he was going inside, and I'm afraid that this might come down anytime. So he run in there to get the men out and when they were coming out the whole thing come down. And in fact I work there for 3 weeks with the other gang to get them out. It took about 3 weeks to get them out."
J.E. How many were killed?
"J.P. There were five of them, all five of them were killed.. They were lying on the road, the boss was the first one. In fact, my shift, my gang found the first one. And then we discovered the last one, but we didn't take him out. Then the following gang took him out. They were telling me that the last one wasn't killed by the fire, but that he died later on. He was covered with the timbers. That's the only time I see a cave in that traped a man in like that. It must have been 1924 something like that with the Mt. Jessup Coal Company."
