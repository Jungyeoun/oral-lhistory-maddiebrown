J.E. - John L. Earl - interviewer
E.L. -Mr. Earl W. Lamb - interviewee English - President Moffitt Coal Company 3rd generation
"J.E. Today were going to interview Mr. Earl Lamb, we are at the Parmoft Corporation in Scranton, Mr. Lamb lives in Centralia Pennsylvania, he was a mining engineer and his father, was also a mining engineer, an official with the Lehigh Valley Coal Company. And Mr. Lamb is a 3rd generation, English and also part Welsh. Mr. Lamb could you say something ............. Mr. Lamb you mentioned that you were born in Centralia, How long did you live there? Did you have your early days there as a youth?"
E.L. I lived there until I was 10 years old.
"L.E. Can you remember anything about the neighborhood in which you were brought up? E.L. Well, the people say 95% of them were working for the Léhigh Valley Coal Co. as various capacities, in the mining industry. Whether directly in the mines or the old breakers; engineering departments. The most interesting thing that is familiar to the old people in the anthracite mining, is a very famous Mammoth Store. It was a huge thir complete with every dėpartments they sold everything there. And that's where the people of the town purchased the bulk of there; whether it was cddthing, food or what have you."
J.E. Was that a company store?
"E.L. It was owned by the Relley Family, who formerly owned the property that Lehigh Valley purchased. The agreement was that they continue the company store and the employees continue to buy there, it so especially on paydays, in those days people bought the food and pretty much anything else. For the next two weeks and that was all delivered by teams of horses and wagons."
J.E. What year are you talking about?
E.L. This would be between 1901 and 1910 or 1911.
"J.E. It was right before the first World war, the decade before the first world war."
"E.L. The town, that was in the period when the first of the major anthracite strikes took place. And, it was long, it was a long period, and the company store stood by the people in the town, so that there was no real hardships. And that was clear in my memory."
J.E. In other words when the strike was on the workers were helped in getting credit by the Reily store.
E.L. If your were identified as a workman by the Lehigh Valley coal company the Mammoth store took care of it.
"J.E. How about the neighborhood? I know that the this is many years ago and you were only ten when you lived there, but the neighborhood, the type of people that lived there were they English, Welsh, were they different natħonalities?"
"E.L. Centralia was typical of an being one of the typical anthracite communities. It was one of those small communities, tatisticadox there was a distinct division siskirtives between the Protastant and roman catholic areas. The Roman Catholiche areas were very built around the Roman Catholic Church. They were mostly the Irish decent. The prostatt community was a mixture of Welsh, English, Scotch, and in that time and in that period there were may very few Polish and Russian, Lithuanian there were mostly the as I've said. It wasn't until some years later better, community spirit the between Catholic and Protestants developed. And then the old feeling, that distortion was carried over from the old Molly Maguires days,..."
J.E. Did your fathers ever talk to you about the Molly Maguires?
"E.L. He knew of them and he talked about them, he said that they were fearful in those days especially the men in the official capacity, but my memory is quite veige I was too young then, To absorb that."
"J.E. You say that the community were divided into separate entities and one would live with themselves and the other would live with themselves, was there much contact between them? E.L. There was very definite entity in them days, each area had there own social thing and athletics things and they didn't have athletic competition, and great rivalry between the two. Now there was no fence, or any other thing to mark the the two areas, but there was definitely....... the people knew there was an invisible fence"
J.E. Were there examples that you knew that there was conflict? Anything major or was it all minor?
"E.L. No, I don't remember anything. Any conflicts of any kind."
"J.E. In your estimation, this is just your opinion, do you thing the distinction was mostly religious? More religious that nationality?"
E.L. Very definitely.
"J.E. How about the schools in the region, the church that your family attended was that near by?"
"E.L. Oh, yes they were small, and methodist and baptist and eposcipaloon, and the first break, that I can remember, some of the very good teachers in the public schools that were located in the Protastant area, were roman catholic women. Who was my first memory of, which was eventually the means of wiping out all means of discrimination."
"J.E. Did the catholic students go to public schools? There were no catholic schools ther. E.L. They had a parochial school, but it was a good mixture in the public schools."
"J.E. how about, you already mentioned about the stores, did you have any peddlers or huckstors? Did you have them coming through the streets and selling their goods?"
"E.L. In those days the farmer from that area were always coming in and selling their goods, they would come in with their fresh eggs and vegetables and various types of meats Now they would go from house to house selling."
"J.E. Was there a lot of food and things bought through them? You mentioned that they would go to the reily store and buy their things to last for two weeks, were things like fresh vegetables, set up on a daily basis for them?"
"E.L. Well, there were certain days of the weeks that they came through, days toward the end of the week."
"J.E. How about transportation, how did you get around town? Mostly walking?"
"E.L. Webl, it was mostly walking; and it was,during that period that the street cars the trolly cars was first installed. Everybody that left the area left on the story Lehigh Valley railroad cars, and at that time they had very good passenger service, east and west."
J.E. Was there a hotel?
E.L. No.
J.E. Was there any boarding houses?
"E.L. There was boarding houses for the bachelor type fellas, mostly."
J.E. Did your family take in any boarders?
E.L. No.
J.E. You say that you left Centralia when you were ten. Where did you move to then?
E.L. Garradsville.
J.E. That's not that far from that area is it?
"E.L. No only about 12,15 miles."
J.E. Was that town the same way?
"E.L. It was a coal town, very similar,..."
J.E. Divided the same way.
"E.L. No, not quite the same way. The difference was that there was no noticeable distinction, and there was both large roman catholic and Protastant areas but not the same visible distinction, that was there."
"J.E. There wasn't as much enitity, as before. People got along. Did you, when you were young, both in centralia, How long did you live in there?"
E.L. We lived in Garradsville for 3 years and then we moved to Frackville.
J.E. And how far from Graddskille was that?
"E.L, Ho, i'd say about 10 miles. Frackville was located on a plateau, and it started because it was outside of the coal measures, and it was selected for the place to live so you wouldn't be affected by mine caves rather than the valleys."
J.E. How about the neighborhood there both ethnically and religiously?
"E.L. Very suitable, no noticeable feelings."
"J.E. When you lived in Centralia, did you play primarily with own English, Welsh and Dastantant kids? Did your family sorta look down on you if you played Irish or Roman Catholic kids. And visa versa too?"
"E.L. They didn't look down on you, there was no feeling in my family at all I was brought up without that feeling on our family, you played with who you played with and that was all."
"J.E. How about in Garradsville, and in Frackville?"
"E.L. No, nothing there either."
"J.E. Was there anything, that you can also remember the churches and the streets that you can remember? Some thing that was different about the homes, the type of existence in Garraddsbille and that of Frackville?"
"E.L. Well, we had a large number of coal company owned houses. Garradsville did not and Frackville was new. It had better housening, and for that period of time it was modern."
"J.E. As for your family, can you remember some of your daily activities, Say what was it like to get up and go to school. What time you woke up etc....."
"E.L. Well, in those days your father left the house by 5:30, or 6 o'clock and you the rest of the day was gaged by the school house. and in the summer time you went out on the lakes or if you were close to the woods you went out and you had periods of chestnut gathering, blueberry gathering or huckleberries as they call them. And other wild berries. And in the summer your life, was made up of things and a lowester that you could do. There was the playground, these were bare spots where you had baseball, or football but there was no such thing as just a playground, You had no hunge like pools over."
"J.E. How about the role of your mother in the household, can you remember what she did?"
"E.L. Well, she was the housekeeper, and that ment in every way. In those days the women baked their own bread, and it was during that period that a bakery shop was started, and the women looked down on the others who went to the bakery. They were not accepted."
J.E. Who took care of the money in the house?
"E.L. In our case our father was the business man. It was in that period, that I can remember that we kept the money in the house. And it was during that period that banks were started and that they weren't accepted at all."
"J.E. How about your role as a child, what were you excepted to do?"
"E.L. Well, I had chores to do including saturday. There was no such thing as janitors, we were assigned to clean the church on Saturday. People donated their time to clean and fix the church. The children had work then....."
J.E. How many children were in your family?
E.L. Four we had two girls and two boys.
"J.E. How about the clothing, was it hand made or purchased?"
E.L. We purchased the clothes in those days at the Mannoth store.
"J.E. How about personal hygiene, did you have plunking in the house?"
"E.L. We had the old outhouse, and on Saturdays we took a bath in the pantry."
"J.E. You mentioned that it was expected of you on your part to clean the church. I expect that religion played an important part of your home life. Did your have any special religious things that you did at home, ang prayers?"
"E.L. Yes, at all times we had a religious pæayer, bible reading in the home. My father was always active in the church and at home."
J.E. What church did you go to?
E.L. To a Baptist.
J.E. You mentioned that your mother had cooked bread in the home and so forth. Did she cook anything that was unique? Perhaps anything English.... Or welsh?
"E.L. I wouldn't say it as such..... there were favorites and of course, things that were economical like stews and things that went a long way and that were not very expensive that was sort of the things that she majored in."
J.E. Was Sunday a special day in the house?
"E.L. It was a special day, there was no sunday paper, no pāay activities, no games. Sunday was kept as a day of rest."
J.E. Any special food?
"E.L. Well, Sunday dinner was a special meal and so was Sunday breakfast. In those days the Welsh and the English always had salt mackerel for breakfast. That was the stands."
"J.E. How about the preservation of food, can you remember how this was done?"
"E.L. Well, every home had a coal cellar, where canned fruits and vegetables were kept. No such thing as refrigeration."
J.E. Now well talk about your dad. You say that your father was an official for the Lehigh Valley coal Company; do you remember how he started off?
"E.L. My grandfather was a rock contractor, sinking shafts, driving tunnels. And my father worked with him until he was 22 years old and then he had an Internat than the main source ional Correspondence school mag the main source of thaining then. He took that course, and eventually the mining classes took place in that town. Supervised by the state mining inspectors, he passed the mining forman's test, eximation."
J.E. So he became a mine foreman. Had he worked in the mines before?
"E.L. Yes, he worked with Grandfather driving tunnels and sinking shafts."
"J.E. Can you remember him talking about his work, can you remember his duties, his responsibilities some of the things that he might have had?"
"E.L. You mean as a foreman? Well, unions were just taking hold in those days, they foreman was the boss. Of course everybody knew everybody else, they knew their families and so forth. And it made quite a difference in a small down like that. The foreman got to know the good miners and the poor miners. Amd the men that were good with tools. The relationship was very good. except for during the strikes, the officials in those days were assigned to keep the boiler plants going. In the mines they deeded steam, there were pumba. And that was the only time that imtamicity between the foreman and the men existed. The fact that the foreman were suppose to work during the strikes."
J.E. When the strike was over did your father get paid?
"E.L. Yes,"
"J.E. What exactly were normal duties of a foreman, what did he do?"
"E.L. Well, he hired the men placed the men and supervised their work as the safety. The rate of pay. In other words he supervised the entire operation, underground."
J.E. Was there any child labor that was used in those days?
"E.L. That was a little beyond, that was just a little prior to that. They did use the children 9, in 10, the breakers. We are getting a little beyond that period."
J.E. Was getting a job in the mining industry a difficult job? Or was it relatively easy?
E.L. There was lots of work. If a man was willing to work it there was employment for him.
"J.E. Now you mentioned that there was a problem that your father would have with individuals during strike periods, can you remember any other labor disrests any other."
E.L. Only during strike time.
"J.E. Was there any particular stories of turmoil that your father might have told you, that particularly touched you ar your father?"
E.L. Not during that time.
J.E. How about the coal and Iron Police? Were they still around in that period?
"E.L. Yes, they were still around, but certąinly during that period they were certainly not excepted. Again we were on strikes, and they would patroll the properties and we certainly many times we went out and picked coal, for their own use. And of course the coal and iron police did not bother them at all."
"J.E. How about when you talk about this period of unrest in the strikes, were there violence delivered against the mėnes itself, was there any, hombingsor destruction to the property???"
"E.L. Occasionally, there was something. They would be dynamiteing certain areas, I don't remember anybody being really hurt, but there were certain areas of destruction."
J.E. How about violence of a personal mature?
E.L. I don't remember any.
"J.E. When your father went to school and took I. C. S. T trained for the job, to be a foreman, How has the advancement in those times, was it relatively easy or was it difficult to set up the ladder of success? Did your father become higher than a foreman?"
"E.L. Yes, he became a superintendent, not in the centralia, but in Girardville. I don't see, or I couldn't see any difference then and now for advancement, because of his ability, and the success of my father, as a supervisor"
J.E. How about the type of person your father was foreman of. Were they mostly Irish? Or......
"E.L. In Garradsville and in Frackville you had the Polish coming in and the first rum of Italians, and the Secilians were mostly the hard rock workers. But there was a mixture of all the European nationalities."
J.E. What do you mean rock men?
E.L. They built the tumners in rock.
"J.E. Now taking a look at yourself, you went to school - during the time while your father was working could you give me an idea on them?"
E.L. I remained in public school until I graduated from the high school Frackville. Before I went on the the Lehigh university. I got a degree in engineering.
J.E. Then did you immediately go into the mines or what?
"E.L. I came to Scranton, and intered into the Hudson Coal company 2 year training course."
J.E. Were they training you to be just a mining engineer?
"E.L. In every fashion of mining you actually, you had a two year program and they went through every department of mining. Whether it was engineering accounting, you were trained in every department of mining."
J.E. After you were trained in that department what position did you hold then?
"E.L. I left immediately and went to the Scranton Coal company. I went first as a engineer so to start the Scranton Coal company on the mechanization level. Hudson was quite advanced in those days, and mechanization was just a period when mechanization was looked on as a thing of what was going on."
"J.E. When was this about, 1920?"
E.L. It was about 1924.
"J.E. Could you give us an idea of the technological fields that were happening the advantages the advances that they were making. In other words, give us some examples of how the mining was being changed."
"E.L. Well first of all, they used what was called mechanical scoops; this was a scoop that was controlled by a double drum machine, on the gangway and that went up into relatively low coal, so that when we did not have to; the scoop was a means of conveance between the miner and the coal. That was then advanced into a sdz shaker shoot; and the Eyecup Company in Germany introduced what they call the shaker shoot which was a driving unit on the main road and a series of pans going out the the mine and as the men shovled the coal onto the pans it was comed to the mine car. That period continued until about 1930, then the american companies such as Godd man and Gefery started the manufacturing the shaker shoot and the drive. And really improved them over the Gernen products"
"J.E. I expect that these machines were very expensive, were they?"
"E.L. Well I don't remember the cost of those machines, but like everything else, I'd say about $2,000."
J.E. Did they improve your output?
"E.L. Well, they made mining in this area, of the lower coal. In other words, when the coal seam was not high enough to ecomidate the mining car, through the working phase, that's when the mechanical scoop and the shaker shoot came in and made available lower coal."
"J.E The Scranton coal company, was that a small coal company?"
"E.L. No, the Scranton coal company, the coal company was started primarily by railroads, scranton cola company was an offshoot from the Ontario & Western railroad. And they had mines from Forest city through Scranton, and the largest on they had was Pinebrook mine which mined the entire section under the central city and the south side the Hill section. And it was unique that the gangways or the headings were named primarlary after the streets Penn avenue, Wyoming Avenue."
J.E. That's the one that someone told me you could still get into.
E.L. Well the south side.
J.E. Was care taken because it was under the city?
"E.L. Very good it was well supervised, and that was the first mine that I had ever been in where the engineering department planned the mining, and where undercutters and the track from place to place. That was a system whereby the place was marked out by the fireboss and the undercut was made by another crew, so that the blasting was not off the solid it was undermined by the cutting, and then blasted."
J.E. How long did you stay with the Scranton Coal company?
E.L. I left there in 1932.
J.E. And there where did you go?
"E.L. Well, at that time part of the Scranton Coal company properties and part of the other independents was combined to form the Penn Anthracite. And I went with them. And I became general manager."
J.E. What were your duties there?
"E.L. General supervision of all the equipment. Engineering, accounting, mining, planning the mine and making it forecasting."
"J.E. Was there, do you remember a time when either when you were at the Sctanton coal company or the Penn anthracite, can you remember any labor didputes, there was unions and they were very strong at that time."
"E.L. Well, during the year it might miss, one year during the Penn anthracite on the so called lump strike took place, it was a fight between the United mine workers of america and the group of dissidents who formed what they called the progressives and they really closed most of the mines in the Lackawanna co. but it was during the early 30's."
J.E. In other worked it was an argument between two elements of the unions and the mine companies were suffering because of it.
"E.L. It was not because of the coal companies, it was because of the unions it was a struggle to get rid of the present leadership of the mine workings. In the end the United Mine workers were still the recošnize mine union. As all the coal companies were under contract to it."
"J.E. This was John L. Bewis,?"
E.L. John L. Lewis.
"J.E. After you were at Penn Anthracite, how long did you work for that?"
"E.L. I stayed there until 1942 and then I came with Moffitt,. who was then taking over the properties of Glenn Alden Coal company in Lackawanna county."
"J.E. How was the mining industry in that time beton, WWII bombing then?"
"E.L. No, during that period the mining industry was struggling to lower our cost and that mainly was the period that maybe I was main the originator of the so called belt mines. The Penn anthracite, we started the first continuous flow belt mines in the world; in the so called Harry Taylor mine. It was a system of conveyors, the chain conveyors replaced the shaker shoots and from that it went to the belt and continued on the belt until it got to the nine car. Which lowered our costs considerably."
J.E. Did you have many of them?
"E.L. Well, there wasn't many places that you could adapt them; but wherever we could we would. and we continued that at Moffit and Moffit financed and put into production 56 slope which at that time had the longest single center belt drive in the world on a 15 degree pitch. And the belt companies because of that property developed various types of nylon fabric, steel belted fabric and that resulted in through the next period of years; for the ability of the belt companies to provide belts for all these western projects, and they even put some of them on 3 and 4 and 5 mile centers. That was the outcome of the struggle to make a belt strong enough for 56 slope."
J.E. What position did you hold at Moffit?
E.L. I was general manager and then President.
"J.E. You mentioned that the mining companies were having trouble leeping the costs down what was the primary rise in the costs, what was going wrong in the industries?"
"E.L. Well, the so called cheeper veins, the high beins to mine were getting scarce the so called first mining was completed years ago. So that the coal companies had to go back into the pillar area, which required heavy timber many of them; in incrouche areas. So the cost, the increase in cost was the problem."
J.E. Was water a problem?
"E.L. Water became increasing with the costs, because you were pumping more tons of water that you were getting coal."
J.E. How about labor costs were they continuing to go up and up?
"E.L. The labor costs, would increase with the new contracts but the work productivity as a miner increased because of the newer mechanization ideas. But the product per man kept pretty abreast of the period of time we were in."
J.E. Shortly after world war II the mining vient into a reality climb wasn't it?
"E.L. Yea that was the beginning of the real serious competition in sales, your installation of central heating was in order, gas was coming in and you were loosing; ho spitals and public buildings and actually you lost the home and public installation."
J.E. Do you think the competition from oil and gas was one of the primary reasons of the decline of the anthracite region?
"E.L. No question about it, the anthracite was struggling they were establishing the anthracite institute, with headquarters in Wilkes-barre they had a very large staff improving the type of burning units and they came out with various types of burners and the anthracite institutes' work provided people who are interested in staying the coal relatively free of certainly improved furnaces."
"J.E. Someone once told me, the only thing that was wrong with anthracite was that it never developed an alternate use for its product it was just heating. If there had been something else for its use for, especially home heating."
"E.L. Well, that's true. Again the institute struggled with that problem for good uses. Many filtering bags for water. They developed a process where developed some they ground the coal very fine and it turned out that it was the best abrasive used in many of the manufacturing agencies. But it never had a very large quantity. (supply and demand)"
"J.E. With the problem that you hear about the energy crisis, Do you think that there would be a comeback for the anthracite industry?"
"E.L. Not locally. The cheapest coal that we get today is the strip call, underground most of these impories are old. Great thousands of them are in black lung and they would certainly not be able to come back into the mines. So you'd be faced with training of entirely new working force. And the fact that going under ground is not considered desirable for the young men. I certainly don’t see any future for the mines, locally."
J.E. Is there coal there?
"E.L. Lots of coal. But it's expensive, and most of it is under water."
J.E. So there are quite a few problems. So you don't see it even with the talk about conserving energy. You have probably heard that a few people have talked about going back to coal as a new source of energy.
"E.L I think that's true in bituminous, but we have tremendous reserves in bituminous we certainly have great reserves in bituminous. That is the soft coal."
"J.E. Could you explain the difference between anthracite and bituminous? One is hard and one is soft, right? As to the mining and as to the quality, what it can be used for. heds are mand flat"
"E.L. Bituminous heds are mand flat, it is easier to mechanize and most of the bituminous today is completely mechanized. We have eliminated the miner who mined the coal and the labor who loaded the coal, because the machines that they are using today not only cut the cost, but they load it. That's the main difference."
J.E. Is mining the bituminous also a deep thing as in the anthracite belt?
"E.L. Yes. Deep mining, and they have 50% of the bituminous in strip mining. Hard caol is on a so called pitch a grade. There you are limited to the area that you can stripike in the soft coal, the bituminous is laying flat and you can strip larger areas."
"J.E. Before we finish I'd like to ask you about thės region, the ending of the coal mines hurt the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area and a lot of the young people began to leave it. Do you still think that this region has something to offer, for the young people, and do you think it has made a good comeback economically???"
"E.L. I think it has, I think that the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area has brought in new industry. Certainly it is a marvelous thing, and the young people have opportunities they still feel as though they do not have the same opportunities in other areas, but certainly I think Scranton and Wilkes-Barr have the opportunities, with the industry that is here now can hold its own."
