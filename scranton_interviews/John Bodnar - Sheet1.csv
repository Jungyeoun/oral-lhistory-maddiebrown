He said I know the lawyer in Vienna and I'll go and talk to him. And he can come to Germany, and it's not so far. And he came about 3 days after"
"he talked to that guy. He came in and came right into the jail and talked to me right away, and we talked and told what's what and, he said that he could do nothing but that he just wanted to talk to us first. He said I got to go to court, and he said that it would take me maybe a day of tow days to get into the court, and to get a judge. And he went and about later on he came back and he said you have to come with me and you have to go to court and about a week later he said that I would come to get you and take you to court. So he took us out and, the state trooper guy, and we went to court and the judge sat on a bench and the germans sat on the side.

J.B. We payed him 25 dollars and we was broke for a long time. And that's what we got and
"we was worried and he was jewish, and he said that's the way that fella thinks and we gave him all we had and we were broke for a long time. And my ticket on the boat was already paid and that was good. And maybe after awhile we had about 11,00 dollars left. And he was shaking."

"J.B. In Philadelphia,."
J. When you lived in Philadelphia did you go some where immediately did you me some where to go?
"J.B. I go to port chester New York. because the man that came with me was from that village and he had a sister out there you see. and I could come that different direction and he were coming together and we don't get any job right away and I got some job on some boat unloading a boat, but as soon as we unload the stuff from the boat the job ends."
J. This is in Port Chester?
"J.B. Yes,"
"J. So you went to Port Chester, because the man you came with had a sister there, and it was in the same village and you just went there. So then what did you do? Where did you go?"
"J.B.Well, I stay home and help there, and I said to his sister and because I can no longer stay there, I have no work, I says that I have to go. But then I said that I had an address in Homestead."
"J. You had an address in Homestead, Pennsylvania. Who gave you the address?"
"J.P. In Homestead my cousin, TimCo. was there. And I knew that before I left Hungary. So I write to him and hse said to come it's alright, in the letter I wrote to him I said that I just came from Europe and I told him about everything. And He said that it was o.k. and if I didn't have the money, He’d send me a ticket. And I still have the 10.00 that I had when I was 19. I said that If I to go station that you want me too, and then I find out that I have no money to come to Pittsburgh. And He told me nothing going If you come to Pittsburgh you have come to Homestead too. And then we go on the train and If you get to Homestead we'll get you. And so, I got my ticket in Port Chester, and I go to Pittsburgh, and It was 10.00. And when I come to New York I was stuck. And I come to the station from Port Chester to New York, and a greenhorn like me get off at New York. And I gotta go to the next station, well, how are you gonna go? But it was all my fault that I was mixed up in a thing like that. The from the station I get out and I take the bus, and go to next station. So I go on a bus and then when I wanna get off I get off. There was a guy on the bus and he helped me off the bus and got me to the train station. And he show me the way, and I got off the bus and two mens came over and started talking to me. And I was lucky that I was with that guy, they turned me this way and this way and this way, and I don't know where I'm going and I stopped and walked away from them and there was a policeman there and I go over to him and show him the paper and tell him I wanted to go to Pittsburgh, and I ask him where is the station, and then He showed me on the clock what time the train leaves and .........and He was the only one on the train and he was reading the paper and after a while he looked at me and he saw that I was a greenhorn, and I went over and started talking to him, and I asked him where he was going and he said that He was going to Chicago. And he was very friendly, and he opened up his suitcase just a little bit. And pulled a bottle of whiskey out. And he had a glass and he filled the glass for himself and he drank it and then he filled the glass for me. From New York to Pittsburgh. And then he pulled out some salimie. And it was good and he had everything in his suitcase. After a while he was drunk and we when to sleep for awhile because all night you go on a train. We wake up and then we have another drink. Then he gi to Pittsburgh and I said that I have to get out, and he said come with me to Chicago, and I tell you I almost went, and took the chande. I don't' know nothing over here in a country filled with wild men. And I said no, and I said I have someone here, so I get out and I went to the station, I meet a lot of people up there and I hear them talking all Slovenic, so I go to them and ask where I want to go and I go to a place, I want to go to Homestead. And He said that you know anyone up"
"there and I said I just come from europe, and I said that I have no, and he said that not so far from the station, where the street car is that's not so far from the station and then is't not too far to Homestead."

"J.B. No trouble to get the job in the mines. You dress like a miner and go in and tell them that you can work in the mines. And then they give you a job, that's not like in the steel mill. In the steel mill it was different, like in the steel mill you don't have no opening a lot of times you have people standing line looking for a job and maybe they would come every morning. And in the mines nobody wants to work in the mines. And in the mines, a lot of the people want to work in the mines and alot of people don't, want to work in the mines. Because the job was dangerous. When I come in over here I was two days in the yacob over here and when I come the next morning about the yacob there was none. He said put your cloths on and some overhalls, and go into the mines and put the shoes on and work on the way I come to work for awhile,"

"test and go answer the questions and if you answer the questions you still out your paper sign the paper and you had the paper over to you, and tell him if you want to be a miner, a head man and so you take that paper and hand that paper to the boss and if the boss needs a man for a miner,he gives you that place if get that you have to have a paper saying that you went to the questions. Otherwise, you just be laborer if you're a miner you get more pay and you're just like a head man."

And in the mines the boys were working driving the mules, and you couldn't be just a boy you got to be about 18 years old. There was mules in the mines, but a lot of places there was not mulse because the mines were like that hill, off by the church, on the hill over here over by & S.&.F. that same thing in the mines."
J. When you joined the mines did they have the union in there?
"J.B. They have the union in there, but not like today. Not so strong, it just started, and the people organized a union and it was named Mitchell, well he was a miner like John Lewis was and was not working strong enough for the men. So finally the work was good for the men they just finally kicked him out and that was that. The union people just don't stand for it. And then when John Lewis got a hold of it the miners had everything."

"J.B. That's why the people when they come over here, most of the people like that when you come over here, and you make $200 dollars and you send do Europe you make $500 hundred dollars. See what I mean Johnny? You see it's worth more I send some money to my father, and every time $200 and that's my fund. And then I send $200 and it arrived alright and no trouble. The second time I have to, send the money and it was no good. There was only one word around there then, and that was R there was A. And I got the letter from Europe, and they say it don't to go through so I go back to the send mine and I go to the band and, we waited and he said that the money is there it's just the wrong name and they corrected it and sent it back over and then I got a letter and it was good."
