J. - John L. Earl - interviewer
T. - Dr. Thomas Handing - interviewee Irish 2nd generation

"J. Today we are interviewing Dr. Thomas Handing, of Scranton Pennsylvania. He is of Irish decent and his father was Born in County Clair in Ireland. Dr. Harding is a dentist and his father arrived in Castelgarden, New York. Dr. Harding do you remember anything that your father might have told you what Ireland was like back in the 19th century?"
"T. No, I can't remember anything at all about his living there. Or why they came here. I never heard them discussing that."
J. Do you have any knowledge why he came to Pennsylvania instead of New York?
"T. Well, he first went to Butlington, New Jersey. He had some relatives there and he worked in a pipe factory. And I guess he didn't like that kind of work and he had some relatives that were here working in the mines, and he migrated to Avoca, instead of New Jersey."
J. Did he go right to work in the mines?
"T. Yes, right away."
J. Can you remember anything that he might have told you about the work in the mines?
"T. Not anything particular, except that the common conversation about the place where there had to work and the kind of work that he might have done. I think they worked 11 hours a day at that time. And then the union labor corrected that to 10 hours. And most of the men that worked in the mines in those days worked 11 hours, esp. the miners, the miners were the men that went in and drilled the holes, and tamped in the powder and blew it up."
And then the laborers want in and shoveled the coal. And that was all I ever heard
J. Was your dad a miner?
"T. He was a miner, He wasn't always a miner, he was an ordinary;laborer at one time."
J. How did he work himself up?
"T. It was his own desire to advance, he was very ambitious. He didn't want to be a laborer all his life. He studies all the books, guide lines, and surveying."
J. Did he have to take a test at that time?
"T. Yes, he took a test but I don't know if they were written tests or not."
J. Do you know the difference in salary between the laborer and the miner?
"T. Well, the way it was arranged in this mine, was they were paid on the tonnage that was produced. They were required 10 of the coal cars a day. I never knew the tonnage of each car, but they would be paid by the tonnage of each car. And the miners would receive the pay and they would in turn pay the laborers."
J. Do you recall what your father would bring home?
"T. No, I don't remember that. It was never discussed. But when I was a boy in the summer I got $1.10 a day. For a low hour a day. About 11¢ a hour."
J. What company did you and your father work for?
T. Pa. coal company.
J. What did you do when you worked in the mines?
T. The first year I tended the door. That was the first summer and then the next summer I drove the mules. I was promoted. .............(explanation of mine works)............
J. How about moving into supervisory positions?
"T. It was difficult for the Irish. To be fair about it, the Irish came here and they knew nothing about the mines. They were farmers in the old county. Their work in the mines was in the hands of the English, Scotch, and the Welsh. Rightly so because they were here to build and start the mines. As I understand it the Irish were the laborers. But as years went by, the Irish came here uneducated and I understand it is because they boycotted the English school. So most all of the green hornes that I knew couldn't read or write. And if someone in the town could read or write would read the mail and write back for the people. But I figure that the Irish where I lived missed a generation of education."
J. Could you tell us about your education?
"T. Well, I was the fourth in our family and I suppose the economic condition was a little better. My older brothers were in the mines when they were 10 and 11. And my sister was the third, and I was the fourth. And then my mother insisted that I go to school and that was terrible because all my pals were in working. And at times we ran away and worked, but we were forced. I went to high school. And the school that I was in had four rooms and there was 2 classes in each rooms. And when the boys reached the age of 12 or 13, (8th grade) they went into the mines. But then you could go to high school, and I was one of the few. So I was an exception in our family."
J. And then you went on to college?
"T. Well I didn't go on to college just then, I was only 15 years of age when I finished high school. And that's not because I was smart. My birthday was in August and I graduated in June. But I came up here to Scranton, to the Lackawanna business college and I went to work on the Erie railroad, as a timekeeper, , and then I was a timekeeper in the DL&W foundry. And from there ..... always wanted to be a physician. And about that time, there was a Dr. Whitie, and knowing all about the tragedies in the mines, he started the first aid movement in the mines and we didn't have as many doctors, and if a man was injured in the mines, we had to find a doctor and if you could find a doctor he couldn't do anything. So he started a system in the coal companies and they selected and was instructed by a physician an how to care for a man if he was injured. And it got to be quite a thing in this region, and in the DL&W they used to give a class every week, and we formed a contest - each colliery form and take care of the people and to see how well they handled a situation. Right along this time, economy was a little difficult and I just happened to try for medical school - I didn't qualify because I only had a three year high school. So I kept trying and they raised the course and I took the lesser of the two so through the advice of people and in 1917 I spend ............ so I got into the army and I was exposed to alot of physicians positions work, so I was used."
"J. Do you have any memories, of you or your dad about the coal and Iron police?"
"T. I remember them, they to my knowledge were selected from the worst elements in our town. And they were selected for that reason. And the coal companies were king. And they would be made deputy sheriffs and given clubs and they used them. I never saw them use them but I saw results of using them. I never heard of them shooting one of anyone. And that started the state troopers."
J. Were there any company stores or company stown in your area?
"T. By the time I came around there was only one company store in our town. They weren't' very big, they only had one colliery and all their workers had to go through Hollisten & Bowman their store. And the stories goes - that some of the men were always paying them off. They were behind. And that was the last of the company stores."
"J. Do you remember any of the prices of the company stores, were they competitive?"
"T. They were competitive, I should think I really don't know."
J. How about your own twist house?
"T. My parents owned their own house, and as soon as my father was married he built his own home, I say he was an ambitious man."
J. Can you remember any union problems and any other labor disputes?
"T. Well, there were many of them for that matter. But it was mostly --- I don't think in our region there were many there were a few shuffles and things and some were beaten up if they were too aggressive. But the main thing was hunger I can remember a lot of hunger. But there was starvation and it all depended on the strikes. 3 months is a long time. There was no aid from anyone, except the unions sometimes they would give something but there wasn't that much."
J. How about the relationships did your father socialize with them at all?
"T. Well, their social status was different, they went to a different church and they lived in a different house. They didn't cross the line very well, socially."
J. Do you think that there was ethnic as well as religious prejudices at that time?
"T. Yes, I can remember. The Irish were the worst when I was a youngster. I think that the Irish were very bad in picking up the education here. But once they got going there were o.k. It is hard to."
"J. Did they supervisors, did they live in different neighborhoods?"
"T. Usually, they lived in the big house in the neighborhood. It was mixed. You could usually tell by the type of home that they came from."
J. Were there different churches in the neighborhoods?
"T. Yes, there were different churches, in our neighborhood there was the presbyterian, the catholic, epispicopal, methodist, and the Bartist. The two biggest church was the catholic church and the presbyterian church. Most Scottish were Presbyterian. I think that most of the Welsh went to the Baptist church."
J. How about when the Poles came into the neighborhood?
"T. They didn't come into our neighborhood. Now this was Avoca but most of the poles came through Smithville which was Dupont Mine. And they didn't have a church but there was one in Duryeea. And that would be a couple of miles each way. It was a Roman Catholic church. There was no Polish national church when I was a boy. That started after we moved to Scranton. I know, and it conflict themselves."
J. Did the Polish church have their masses in Polish?
T. Yes. The mass was in Latin. And the gospel and sermon was in Polish. That 's why they went down there.
J. Can you remember anything about your old neighborhood? Can you describe certain things about it.
"T. We had a garden. We always had a cow when I was a kid. And my mother had 12 children, but One died as an infant. I think that we were a little better off than the average. There was a wood down beyond my grandfathers' place. It must have been cultivated, long before I was born, and there was a little space where it was level and fenced in. And my grandfather bought the lease on that, from the coal company, and he and my father hired a man and had that place plowed and they planted in the spring. Potatoes, hay, tomatoes, corn, and they would get some help from some friends, and then in the fall when they would harvest it. There would be many of the neighborhood there helping and taking it was plentiful and good. Every place was filled."
J. Where did you keep the food?
"T. In the cellar. The cellars were stone walls, and it dept things cool, and some people would build holes in the ground."
J. How was the meat preserved?
"T. Well, we never had enough meat that we had to preserve it. As I remember, But in this home we had places to store..... they had ice cubes......"
J. Who handled the money in your house?
T. My father.
J. Was your father always a miner?
"T. Well, no, when we came to Scranton, he wanted to get out of the mines. He worked around the hotel Casey, and he adjusted and invested in the market."
J. Did any of you brothers go into the mines permanently?
"T. Well, my oldest brother went into the mines when he was 10. He was 24 when he came to Scranton and he never went back into the mines. But he had one of the finest eating places in this region in years. And he would work a couple of times during the strikes. Then he started to follow the races, he was a gambler."
"J. How about clothing in the home, did you mother make it or was it purchased"
"T. My mother was kept busy patching the holøs, and we purchased it."
J. How about personal hygiene.
"T. That was quite a problem. But that ole wash tub was used for quite a lot of things besides washing. There was no plumbing. We would have a couple of kids in the utb at onee. The miners would bath every day after work, because they were so black and dirty. And women would have the water boiled."
J. Was there any religion practiced in the home?
"T. Yes, the family rosary and the grace before meals. And we went to church a sunday and there were missions about every year. There was better church attendance than other is today. That was shown mostly as work. It was very hard for the Irish to get work. They were kept down. Our schools the Irish were in the schools but the Welsh were treated better. But when I started we were treated better."
J. Do you have any remembrances of the games and amusements that you might have player?
"T. Sports were very prominent, and there was no money to buy toys you had to make up them yourself. We had stones for the bases, and we made our own little things. But the biggest thing emotion in sports was the caledonians events. They would put on field sports, 100 yard dash, mile runs,pole vaulting. And they used to cover Pittston, Scranton, and that was very competitive on the ethnic groups too, and the religious groups. There might be some betting etc., but that was the biggest promotional thing."
J. Thank you.
