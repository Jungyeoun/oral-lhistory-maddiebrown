Daniel J. Prisco:
"D.P. I think you should tell Mr. Earl about those incidents in the mines when, men were killed, could you tell us a little about that?"
"S.G. Well, I'll tell you, there is times when you couldn't help but get in there and help and when you got in there, there was always danger, you got killed. You had to go in there and get things cleaned out and get things in order. And when you went in there you got killed or hurt."
D.P. What I'm leading to is what they used to do years ago. They would put the corps on a stretcher and then what did they do?
"S.G. Yea, put the body on a stretcher and get what they could out, or they would put them on a stretcher or if there wasn't a stretcher they would put the man a bard or whatever was there."
D.P. And then what would happen?
S.G. They would carry them out.
"D.P. I remember incidents that happened in the mines, and this goes back years and years ago. A man would be killed in the mines. He would be brought and put on the porch or in the kitchen of the house. And there was no protection given no insurance from the mines, and the widow would be responsible for that man to bury him and to take of all the expenses. Now that's what I was sorta of leading up to. Was this before the time of the union, before it was organized? Do you think?"
"S.G. It came about a little better with the union came around. They looked into it and saw that the body was taken better care of then. It was much better when the union was around, and that was better on the people that were livin'."
"J.E. You mentioned that you got 5,000 dollars from the company because of your accident. Was that unusual for that time? Was there anyone else hurt with you? And did they get the same amount of money?"
"S.G. Yes, yes, he didn't get quite the same amount but it was pretty close, because he still had one eye left. So he got partial disability because of the disfigurement."
J.E. This was the compensation because you could no longer work in the mines?
S.G. There was things that I couldn't do.
"J.E. This was in 1921, was that new that they did things like giving money to disabled men?"
"S.G. When I came in it was 1915 or 1916, and they didn't have nothing. And this was a federal act ...."
"J.E. Could you describe some of the funerals, some of the wakes then?"

S.G. Yes.
D.P. Were the mines shut down for the religious holidays?
"S.G. Some it would depend on what class of people were working there. Like polish, the polish people how had holidays."
D.P. Do you remember any of those religious holidays that the mines were shut down? Because to Hazleton when there was the assumption the mines would be closed down. And the men would be in church with their wives and bouquets of flowers. Was that the same here in Dickson?
