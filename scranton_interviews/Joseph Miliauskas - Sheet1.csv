"Summer, 1973"
E. - John L. Earl - interviewer
M. - Mr. Joseph Miliauskas interviewee first generation Lithuanian

"E. Today we are interviewing Msgr. Joseph Miliauskas, Ist generation lithuanian. And came from Lithuanian. And you and your mother came over in 1900. When did you father come over here?"
"M. The year before that. He got enough money and he borrowed from my uncle and he sent us the tickets to come over here. And it was on a freighter and I guess it took us a week to get over. After I started in the mines in the Dunmore veins, I enjoyed it. I got to know the places. And every mine was different. And if the vein was 3 or 4 feet tall that was called a vein. It was like a regular layer. And they would pay us so much a ton. And that's how you earned your money. Now the rock, if you have 2 feet of coal you couldn't keep on going in there too long. Before you could put the tracks in there you have to drill and fire the rock. They paid you for the rock by the yard. When you get your due bill, you get that to tell you how much money you would get, you'd look at that due bill, and you think that you couldn't live on that and you went to John and said that you couldn't live on that he would see what he could do and maybe put on a yard of rock. And you pay for the dynamite by the yard."
"E. Could a vein of coal be at the bottom, like you mentioned that it might be only 2 feet high and that you would have to work on your stomach. Suppose the vein started to go down?"
"M. Well, you'd stay with it. And in some places that would never happen that it would go down. You'd have hills in the mines. The miners got paid so much for a ton of coal by the cars. And I think that the cars would be able to carry four or five tons. Still when they were hauling it, the coal, some of it would fall off. Add the people along the railroad would come and pick it up and there was enough coal there that they wouldn't have to buy any. The higher vein of coal that you had the more money you would make. But there weren't too many high vein s in the Dunmore vein where we were. But a good miner in the morning as soon as he comes in will check the roof."
E. Was gas ever a problem? Was there ever gas in the mines?
M. Very very rarely. The ventalisation in some places they would find it. But it would be because of bad ventilation. And then they would put a door up so that there would be more air. They knew where to put these doors up and they had these places where all the smoke would go up in the mines. And the water that was there they would pump that out. The pumps were going constantly. You'd find a lot of rats in the mines and when you'd see the rats go from one place to another that's a sign of danger. I don't know they had premonition. You go with the rats.
"E. Now, you worked as a young boy in the breaker? What was that like?"
"M. Well, I tell you when I got that first certificate for that first quarter, I got a job I didn't tell my mother or father until I come home from getting a job. When I came home from the breaker... the machinery does most of the work taking the coal from the Breaker. but when they fire the coal and the rock, you'll always find some coal and rock mixed together. Well, it's up to the slate pickers to get out. And you had different size screens for the different size coal. It was our job to pick out all the slate. Because it wont' burn."
E. How fast did the coal move along?
"M. Well, it keeps on moving and it's up to the five that's on each shoot to watch and get the slate. It was a very tedious job. We put in 10 hours. So when I got in the mine that was paradise."
E. What did you do in the mines?
"M. Well, the only job that I had was to open and close my door."
E. How many crew did a mine have?
M. Two. One going up and the other coming down. The miner usually has the privilege of hiring his own labor. The miner is the boss and you have to take orders from the miners.
E. How many laborers were there for a miner?
M. Usually one. Unless you have a high vein of coal and then you could have a couple more.
E. You mentioned that they blasted out the rock. What did they do with the rock?
M. Just dump it out in the dump someplace.
E. Was that sent up in the cars?
"M. Yes, they had to. But they would pay you for how many yards of rock that you took down in two weeks. Then from there on you would take out the coal."
E. You mentioned that the normal way down into the mines was the man hole. What was that?
M. Well it was a path way down. some places there was mules down there that would haul the coal up and it was up the mule drivers to take care of the mules.
E. Was the manhole just a main shaft down?
M. it was just like a street going down. Some Places you had to stoop down to get in. But most of the places you could just walk out straight. You had to keep your eyes' open.
E. Was it well lit?
M. No there were no lights there you had lamps.
E. You mentioned that once you got sacked. How did that happen?
"M. Well, if you don't go your work. It's up to the boss, if he thinks that you are not doing your work.... he'd send you home."
E. How long did it take a normal trip to go through those doors?
M. Just a couple of minutes.
E. How many cars were there?
M. 20 and 30 cars.
E. You mentioned that earlier that you were familiar with the mines from being a nipper. And you got to know some of the tricks.
"M. Somethings you would have a can of oil and sometimes you would have a fella come along and swipe it on you. I used to have a wire under that, and sometimes you'd hear, that there was a different rout. And one day my lamp was pretty near empty. I ran and I grabbed that oil can .........."
E. What was the electricity used for?
M. For the motor.......................
"E. You mentioned that the miners being that many of them spoke broken english, what nationalities were some of them?"
"M. Well, in Forest City; there were alot.. and there were six different parishes in that town. And there was a population of 5,000 people. The Welsh we won't count, Poles, Slovenes, Lithuanian, Slovak, Italian, and the Greek Catholic."
E. They were all the ethnic groups that worked in the mines?
"M. Yes,"
E. How about the neighborhood? Were they all different ethnic groups too?
"M. Oh, sure yea. These Slovenes they were hard workers. And every Saturday night they had a quart of beer sitting in the backyard. They'll always have one that can plat the accordion And they were sitting there were singing.... and having a good time. They were easy people to get along with."
E. Did most of the ethnic groups stick to themselves or did they mingle with the other people?
"M. Oh sure, they were all in the saloons and there were all kinds there."
E. Any fights?
"M. Occasionally, there were some. Forest city had a pretty good reputation the county seat, and it was very rarely that you heard of a case going to montrose. If they had a little trouble you would go to the justice of the peace and maybe you were found a couple of dollars.... But very very rarely."
E. How about where you lived and where your parents lived? Was that a Lithuanian neighborhood?
"M. There was no neighborhoods. Alongside of us at different times there were alot of' different people. And we rented when we first got there. Then we built a.... well, my parents bought two lots, and we built a home at that time that cost 22 hundred dollars. For three families. My brother worked then and my father worked then and I was working then and we paid it off in a couple of years. We had a garden on one lot and the house was on the other, and my mother had lots of flowers on the front of the house. Our own potatoes and we had our own cow, and we had ducks, chickens, geese, but more ducks than anything else. We would raise a pig and then we would slaughter it and then have that meat. And then we would put about a half an inch of salt on it and keep it there it was good."
E. Is there any special dishes that you used to have?
"M. No you couldn't afford them. Those days mostly come friday... sour milk and potat√•es. And I........... We bought very very little meat, because pretty near all the food we raised ourselves. My mother was 94 when she passes away. She was in that garden from morning till night."
E. What did you do in the winter time for food?
"M. Well, we had pretty near all that we wanted saved up."
E. How about when you were young and you were working in the mines.... did you go to school at all?
"M. Well, I started in work and I never even dreamt of school. But then I went to school.... on my pastor's recommendation."
The end .........
