"Bodnar: I'm in Naticoke, Pennsylvania interviewing 2 gentlemen: Mr. Ben Grevera and Anthony Piscotty - spelled with a Y at the end. In the beginning I'll deal with each of you separately so I can just get some basic information and later on we can just talk. Mr Grevera, would you tell me where you were born and where you grew up?"
"Grevera: I born in the city of Naticoke, and grew up here all my life. Been around here all my life in Naticoke. I'll go back to the time my dad came from Germany. Come to this country when he was about 8 years old. Nine years old he started working the breakers, 9 hours a day for a quarter a day. And from breaker, as a young man when he went in the mines he worked for Susquehanna Collieries for 53 years. Just in this one colliery. And when he got older - this is the history of my father - he asked for a lighter job, cause he couldn't do any mine work cr leaving in cold. They told him that they had paid him for what he had done. My old dad had to quit work. Later on, I went into coal mined. I mined coal and I mined in the gangways."
Bodnar: Let's jump back a little bit. What year were you born?
"Grevera: November 3, 1913."
"Bodnar: 1913. A year younger than all the guys that We thought there wasn't one this morning born after 1904, I don't believe. You were born in 1913, Your dad probably came here 10 years before that or so? No, even more than that."
(LAUGHTER)
GREVERA AND PISCOTTY 2
Grevera: My dad'd be over a hundred years old today.
Bodnar: All right.
Grevera; 1890-something or other.
Bodnar: In the 1890s. You said he came from Germany.
"Grevera: Yeah. ______________, Germany."
Bodnar: I your name a German name?
"Grevera: Grevera? No, I'm Polish."
Bodnar: OK. All right. So this was the area of Poland that was controlled by Germany. This was the Prussian sector of Poland.
Grevera: That's where Germany took--Prussia over. My people were taken from Prussia into Germany. That's where they were raised.
Bodnar: Did your father ever say why he came?
Grevera: He was only a boy-8 years old anyway when he come here.
Bodnar: So it was his parents that brought him to
"Grevera: And my mother's family came from the same country- Prussia, to Germany and back here."
Bodnar: Why did they come to Naticoke. Is there a particular reason?
Grevera: I don't know.
(TAPE STOPPED)
"Bodnar: Excuse me. Just a second. OK, Mr. Grevera, we're talking about your father who came as a child with his parents from the German sector of Poland. He came over here and began to work in the mines, Colliery. You are born in 1913. Is your father still working?"
GREVERA AND PISCOTTY 3
Grevera: Was he still working then? Oh yeah.
Bodnar: Are you in a large family?
Grevera: Five boys.
"Bodnar: Five boys. Are you the oldest, or the youngest?"
Grevera: I'm the youngest.
Bodnar: What about the 4 older boys? What about their work? Do they sit at home while your father goes to work?
"Grevēra: No, when my brothers got older they started work around the colliery. One brother worked on the outside as a shaftsman, and the other 3 boys, they went in the mines. One worked in rock tunnels and L then he went on to coal."
Bodnar: What was a rock tunnel?
Grevera: Where you drive a tunnel to hit into another vein of coal.
Bodnar: OK. All right.
Grevera: Then you hit the vein of coal then they would call that a gangway after. That's where you mined your coal. You drove off...
Bodnar: The gangway.
Grevera: Right.
Bodnar: But the rock tunnel - so those guys are just taking out rock?
Grevera: All rock.
Bodnar: Would you get paid less for taking out rock than you would for coal?
Grevera: They would get - they called it consideration rate. So much per day.
"Bodnar: Did your brothers then ever get to mine coal too, and become miners?"
"Grevera: No, I was the only one went mining. But when you're in mining, you go on a contract. Pay so much per yard."
GREVERA AND PISCOTTY 4
Bodnar: How old were you when you started to work around the mines?
"Grevera: I started to work in the mines, I was about 25 years old. Cause I worked on the truck tiers before then. That's when I started work on the trucks, ice truck and that, you know."
"Bodnar: Was that your first job, working on the ice truck?"
Grevera: Yeah.
"Bodnar: Doing what? Grevera: Carrying ice. Delivering. Going from home to home. Bodnar: You did that for...? Grevera. Till I got married. Then I started working in coal mines. I had to go to work for more money, then, when you got married."
Bodnar: What were you doing with the money you made on the ice truck?
Grevera: I was making my family living.
Bodnar: Were you contributing any of your money to your parents?
Grevera: I lived with my father-in-law.
"Bodnar: Oh, you were with your father-in-law."
"Grevera: We were getting 18 dollars a week, and I was giving him $5 a week to help him out too."
"Bodnar: That was after you were married. But as a young boy, before you were married?"
"Grevera: Well, I was with my dad, then, working on the truck then too, you know."
Bodnar: Was your dad working on the truck?
"Grevera: No, I worked for an ice cream service."
Bodnar: What did you do with your wages then?
GREVERA AND PISCOTTY 5
Grevera: I'd give them to my dad.
Bodnar: What about your mother?
Grevera: My mother was dead. She died when I was 14 years old.
Bodnar: How did she die?
Grevera: She had a stroke.
Bodnar: So how did you live then? It's just you and your father and the brothers?
"Grevera: No. After my mom died, then my brothers started leaving to get married. So me and my dad was alone. I used to love when I first. started - what take was I getting? Seven dollars a week on the ice truck, and 7 days a week. I'd come home with that pay to my dad, he'd give you a quarter to spend. Then later on, as I worked down there, I got old enough to drive the truck. Then I went and I was getting $18 a week, I think. Before I got married."
"Bodnar: You worked on the ice truck and then you helped, you and your father lived together. Was your father still working in the mines?"
Grevera: Yeah.
Bodnar: And what colliery was he at then? Grevera: He worked all this time in Susquehanna.
Bodnar: Is that Susquehanna Coal Company?
Grevera: Yeah.
"Bodnar: Now, then you don't really start in the mines till the late thirties, right?"
"Grevera: Well, '37, I'd say. Around 1937. Somewhere around there."
Bodnar: And then how long did you stay in the mines?
"Grevera: Seventeen years __________. Then I got out, cause I have third stage asthma. I had to get out of the mine."
GREVERA AND PISCOTTY 6
Bodnar: Did you have a job in the mines that had particularly a lot of dust?
Grevera: Yeah.
Bodnar: Doing what? What was it?
"Grevera: I drove gangways and _________ not just in coal alone, but the gangways you drove in rock and you blow this rock out. Then you'd get your road in, then you drained your top vein, that's where the coal was. Fire this coal out, cleaned the coal out, then you had maybe 6, 7 feet of rock again to blow up. This is what they called a gangway. We'd go in there 60 fifty feet, then you'd drive a shoot up for ventilation. Before you'd get this ventilation in there, the air that you used for jackhammers to drill..."
Bodnar: Hoses?
"Grevera: You'd have the hose in there to get air for you to breathe. This is how you had to go. Later on, they come up with the respirator. But then I couldn't use them, 'cause I couldn't breathe with it on. I was really closed up with asthma."
"Bodnar: Did your father ever have a breathing, asthma, problem?"
Grevera: They didn't have the respirator then.
Bodnar: But he never got a lung problem?
Grevera: Oh yeah. He died from that.
"Bodnar: Did you, before you ever went in the mines, did you ever say hey, I'm not going to go in there.? You saw how your father suffered."
"Grévera: I said I'll never go in the mines and get sick like my father. My 4 uncles -that's my father's brothers - died with asthma. My dad died with it. And I says, I'll never go in there. When I got married, well, what was there left? I had to go in and make a living."
GREVERA AND PISCOTTY 7
Bodnar: You didn't see any other alternative?
Grevera: There was no other way out. I didn't have enough education.
Bodnar: What about leaving the area?
"Grevera: Well, I guess you could leave the area, but I didn't have any intention of leaving home."
Bodnar: Why?
"Grevera: Cause my dad had the home there, and left his home to me after he died. And I stayed with him, so I didn't want to leave home. And then I had children after I got married. We had our children too, you know, and I wasn't going to go away from here. And I still live in the same room. All the brothers and all, we were born and raised in that home."
Bodnar: The home your dad had?
Grevera: That's the home my mother
Bodnar: Who built that home?
Grevera: Susquehannah Coal Company.
Bodnar: It was a company home?
Grevera: It was a company home. They used to pay $6. and a quarter a month rent.
Bodnar: And did your father have a chance to own it finally?
"Grevera: Yes. When the coal company sold the property, they had the first choice."
Bodnar: When was that?
Grevera: 1928 or '29. '29. 1929.
"Bodnar: Why did they decide to sell, then at that time?"
GREVERA AND PISCOTTY 8
Grevera: Cause they were going out of the...
Bodnar: Housing business.
Grevera: Yeah.
"Bodnar: OK. Let me drop back a little bit, Mr. Piscotty, and let me kind of establish your origins. Would you tell me where you were born, and when, and a little bit about your parents and coming to this area?"
"Piscotty: will-you? I was born in Plymouth, 1908. Don't tell Ben over there, (LAUGHTER) I worked at the Chauncey. First I started off at the Chauncey as a breaker, just a little colliery on the other side of the river."
Bodnar: The Chauncey Colliery.
Piscotty: Yeah.
Bodnar: What company was that over there?
"Piscotty: Chauncey. Chauncey owned it. My dad was the breaker boss. About 13 I had to go to continuation school one day a week, see, I was too young. I think we had more dust in that breaker, that you couldn't see your hand in front of you. See, in them days they didn't have it like they do today. They wet the stuff before it comes up and it's harder of course to clean, so I was a brakeman. When it's dry, it's easier to clean, .. only you have all that dust. That's about it. So I worked there for I guess about 3 or 4 years I worked at the Chauncey. The breaker burned down while I was working there, the Chauncey breaker. We had a lot of power killer with that power more than once to get...you touched something on the bottom or the top, everything was. The breaker burned down, you know, my dad was still a breaker boss. My brother was running the engine up there. He's pulling cars up. They built a new breaker. So I was boiler room tender. I had a good job then, boiler room tender. So after I got back into the breaker - started the new breaker - my dad said to me one day,"" you know, Tony, your brother's working here, you're working here. Why don't you go get a job somewhere else?” I said “why sure, I'll get a job. I'll go over to the Loomis and I'11 hire myself.” Never asked why just sent in the stuff and got myself hired, and I was working there. I don't know how many years I worked there - now let's see - I must have worked there 11, 12 years at the Loomis. It was during suspension hours there, 1925 strike, when you had that. That was a long suspension you had along there."
GREVERA AND PISCOTTY 9
Bodnar: That's right. '25.
Grevera: That was 6 months
"Piscotty: Yeah, that was the longest we ever had. I remember them days very well because after working these number of years, that suspension, we used to build bunks, the way you used to go. Play cards all night, and in the morning go to shetting shanty, take yourself a bath and go to sleep, sleep all day."
(LAUGHTER)
Bodnar: Because there was a strike.
"Piscotty: Yeah, because we were on strike. That's what we used to do."
Bodnar: This is in '25.
"Piscotty: I remember the days, I'd get me a loaf of bread, and some butter - we had cow's - butter and some milk and coffee, that's what you got, and that was it for the whole day, and We didn't have too much of this. Of course we had a cow, we were lucky a couple of cows, we were lucky we didn't get any."
GREVERA AND PISCOTTY 10
Bodnar: Now you were living in Plymouth yet? Right?
Piscotty: Yeah.
Bodnar: Why did your father want you to leave the Chauncey? Why did he say the thing about go get a job?
"Piscotty: There was 3 of us there, there was too many from one family. Then he had 2 for his first cousins. The boss said to him, Joe, you got too many working from the family. So I said, do you think I can get a job, yeah, I'll get a job over at Loomis and I worked there 11 years. Worked there for quite a number of years too."
Bodnar: What was your father's name?
Piscotty: Joe.
Bodnar: Did he migrate from Poland?
"Piscotty: No, he was born here. My father was born here. llis' grandfather come from Poland. He worked up in the Grand Tunnel too, he used to work up there for when he come here. His name was Mike. Of course my dad was a big man. I'm the smallest one in the family. He was a strong man. He didn't have too much education, he away. Made some patents for George Lee down there, and all this. He'd give him $10 gold pieces for it and all and I guess they still have them somewhere. Where they're at, I wouldn't know."
"Bodnar: But you were raised in Plymouth, then? The family was growing in Plymouth?"
"Piscotty: ____________, yeah. Eight of us."
"Bodnar: Now, 8 children?"
GREVERA AND PISCOTTY 11
"Piscotty: Eight of us, Five boys and 3 girls,"
Bodnar: What about some of your other brothers and sisters - did they have to go to work early as well? And where did they go?
"Piscotty: Yeah. My brother George. He worked for ________. When it closed down, then he come to Susquehannah and worked in the breaker here, and then he left. He went to Chester."
Bodnar: Why?
"Piscotty: He was working for a concern down there, he was a tool man or something. Took care of all of their plumbing and stuff down in Chester. He's retired now. He's older than I. The next brother, Mike, he's in Plymouth."
Bodnar: Did Mike work in the breaker in mines for a while too?
"Piscotty: He worked in the mines. He used to work with Benny in the mines, he was a rock man. He was in bad shape, but exercises sort of helped that asthma. You'd be surprised how that helps, you know, that exercise. So Mike is still living at home. He got himself a home, out and a flood came down and made a mess out of it in 1972, so he built him a home there. Of course Uncle Sam helped, you know, -helped fix it up and"
"Bodnar: Your sisters as young girls, did they have to work in any of the mills around here?"
"Piscotty: Yeah, they worked in the mills.Louise my sister still single, she still lives in Plymouth. My sister Louise - Lizzy - she's away from here. She's down in Chester has got 2 liquor stores out in Connecticut. I mean, not Chester, but John.' Chester is a tool man out in Niagara Falls. He works out there."
GREVERA AND PISCOTTY 12
"Bodnar: Your father was a breaker boss, you tell me, What was the job of a breaker boss? What exactly did he do?"
"Piscotty: He took care of all the men. He set everything, he fixed up, done all the repair work at night. Every night there was so much things to do, and if the machine wasn't running right, he'd had to see that it was fixed up, take care of her. And the breaker, that regular mechanic. That's just like being a mechanic, see. He could take care of it. He started me off when I was a youngster, showed me how to lay the sheet iron, how to cut it, what to do, how to do it. When I went to Loomis, I was tops."
Bodnar: Laying the sheet iron - where would you lay sheet iron? For what purpose?
Piscotty: In the chutes.
Bodnar: And that would wear out once in a while?
"Piscotty: Sure, that wears out, yeah, slate wears it out fast, and coal, and you’d have to keep repairing it, you know, keep it going so they wouldn't block up your _______. When you've got the stuff coming in from the mines, you can't stop that; you gotta keep this thing rolling. Everybody's working, everybody's getting paid, you gotta keep making money for the people. _______________, if you don't, then they don't need you. You know how that goes today. You gotta produce. Well, that's what it was them days. I know my dad told me that when he started in the breaker he was about 8 years old."
Bodnar: Eight?
"Piscotty: Yeah, when he come in. When he'd come over and the boss'd find a piece of slate by the floor and he'd kick in the ears, and whack it. It's true. They used to do that to my dad quite a number of times."
