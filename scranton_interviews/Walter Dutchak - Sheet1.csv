W. Walter Dutchak - interviewee Ukrainian
A. Angela Vauter - interviewer

"A. Today we are interviewing Mr. Walter Dutchak who is s second generation Ukrainian. Mr. Dutchak you mentioned to me that your parents came from the Ukraine, could you tell me what they might have mentioned that what the Ukrainian was like?"
"W. First of all I want to tell you that my first language in the United States was Ukrainian, my folks did not know English, and all the people that my folks kenw did know only one language and that was Ukrainian. I will never forget the time when my father took me and my sister to grade school which was in Annex, and none of us knew English, and what a time the poor teacher had trying to find out the names of us. And her not knowing Ukrainian, and my father not knowing English."
A. Do you remember what village that your parents came from?
"W. Yes I know the village and the area. It was a large province which was called Galichia. And at that time that area contained 7 or 8 thousand Ukranians. They were under the old pre-war world I empire of Austria. My father came from the northeastern part of Galichia, from a county called Barroke. And from a village called (County) Roohaffin. It was about 150 miles southwest of where my father lived."
A. Were your parents married when they came to America or were they married before.
"W. No, they were not."
A. At what age did they come over here?
"W. My father was born in 1885 and my mother was born in 1890. My father came to this country when he was about 20, and my mother 18. When my mother came to this country she came to Nanticoke,."
A. Why did she go to nanticoke?
"W. There, there was some people of her immediately village, of the county of Roohoden. And naturally they got her a job with a lady that owned a tavern and there she learned how to cook and bake. From there she went to Scranton, where she had more immediate relatives. And became employed as a cook and a lauddress, and so forth. By Mr. Bossack, who was then a banker."
A. Did she come through the port of New York?
"W. She came through the port of New York, and of course my father was on a different line. My father had a more enjoyable time riding on the ship more than my mother. He was destined to go to providence, Rhode Island. And instead of going there to Providence, Rhode Island. He was booked to go to Providence, Pa."
"A. Why was he going to Providence, Rhode Island?"
"W. He was going to Providence, Rhode Island because he knew a man that had some type of shoe repair shop and he could do things with leather. And he asked my father to come and live with him and learn a trade in leather. But unfortunately, it never came to be."
A. Where did he first stay when he came to Providence?
"W. My father was dumped off a street car at the end of the line with his suitcase, in October of 1905, awaiting this person of Jewish origin. He didn't know he was in Providence Pa., he thought he was in Providence Rhode Island. Now after about 2 or 4 hours of sitting there there was a gentleman of lithuanian origin, and there was still the barrier of language."
A. When he first got here did he rent or where did he live?
"W. Well, for three days and three nights he put my father up on the back porch. and all the available space was taken. After 3 days my father obtained work in the sandy banks colliery. Of the Scranton coal company."
A. Did your father then go and live in a Ukrainian neighborhood?
"W. Well, my father lived in the Lithuanian neighborhood of North Scranton. And from there he walked down to the colliery, and at that time they didn't have an 8 to 5 working day, and sometimes he would be working 10 and 12 hours. But my father then found out that there was a church of Ukrainian background and he went there. And there was a Ukrainian grocery store and sometimes they would go there and that became a social place and where my father could find some friends."
A. How did he meet your mother?
"W. Well, my mother would be visiting this fellow of the grocery store, and that's where my father hung out. And he introduced my mother to my father. They got married about 1908. By that time my father had saved around 500 dollars and they knew that area needed a Ukrainian parish so that's what my father did with the money, he and the grocery store owner put money into the church. They didn't know what to name the church, despite the fact that my father gave 500 dollars. So they named it after the patron st. of Latimer, and that name was not well known, so it became known as a Ruthenian-Greek Catholic Church. And one digs into the name of Ruthenian it was still Latin for Ukrainian. And that was the church that my father was married in."
A. Do you remember any of the customs of the weddings that the Ukranianns had?
"W. Well, first let me tell you about how my father wooed my mother. Mr. Bosack had my mother working for him. And she was recommended to my father as being a good woman. And after two weeks they were married. They didn't have too much of a wedding. It was during the time of the depression and food and shelter were things of existence. And there was no such thing as a stove or a refrigerator. Things were bought and used day to day. But later on as time went on they became nicer and home cookiÄ¡ng came out and all was good."
A. What school did you attend?
W. I was enrolled in the grade school and little and little we managed english. And then I went to a mechanis chold that was four grades only and then from there we went to 43 school. And that was up to grade 8. And I graduated from 14 school.
A. You mentioned that you went to highsche college right?
"W. Well, I didn't know if I wanted to take the courses and my father and mother were aiming me in that direction. I went in 1928, to Bucknell University. I thought that chemical engineering was my goal, and then I realized that I would have some trouble. So my second term I redesigned into mathematics, and it was too hard. So I changed to a pre-med course."
A. You mentioned that you worked in the mines? When did you work?
"W. Well, I began working in the mines in 1926 at the age of 16. My parents did not want me to go out peddling newspapers and they were more interested in me doing my homework, and they wanted me to know the violin. But I at that time was able to find work in the old Hyde Park colliery. And under his nose I sneaked in and worked and then about after 4 or 5 days they began to wonder why I was getting up at 5 and coming home at 4."
A. Do you remember how much you got paid?
"W. Yes, but I only got this employment for about 5 days. And it was about 18 dollars a day as a laborer. And the pay that I got I gave to my father and he gave to my mother. I worked off and on then in the summer and worked in the mines and other places. And then came the terrible depression, and I couldn't pay the 200 dollars tuition that I could finish my school."
A. Do you remember anything about your bosses?
"W. Yes, the reason that I got this job in 1930 was because of an old straw boss. and that was a person that wasn't really on the pay. but he helped. day by day, because of his experience. In 1930 as the depression came through the mines closed down. The mine operators said that the best way to operate was to consolidate. So 3 or 4 collieries that were in the same area came into one and they had to lay off thousands of men. And getting a job in the mines was even a competitive thing. And it was hard to get a job, to further my education. And my job was to load 4 cars or 4 tons of coal and the timber and that paid me and the miner was paid dollars."
A. You mentioned that you knew something about the mines themselves the heights of the vieng.
W. Many people forget that the nines of Pennsylvania funnished the people with hard coal. It took millions of years for the coal to come.
A. Was there any difference in mining these different regions?
"W. Yes, there was quite a bit of difference in mining these palaces. In Scranton your lowest vein was about 18 inches. And the highest vein was about 40 feet in height. And that was about the hardest vein to mine. The difference in mining were such that the mines in Hazleton were mined differently than the mines in Scranton because they were up higher. In Scranton we could manage the mines by taking so much of the bottom bench and that means that you start at the bottom and go up. And it was about 12 to 14 feet and then later on when people established the main roads and the side roads. Coming back, you take the pop all the way to the roof. And people would have to fire holes and the miner would come back a week or two later and get out all the coal. Later on the safety laws changed and they the miners had to be there when the laborers blasted the coal."
A. Did most of the people have gardens in your neighborhood?
"W. Yes, they all had gardens. And they raised their own chickens. And quite a number had cows and their gardens were something to really see."
A. How did the people preserve food?
"W. Most of the preservation of the food took place such as the, meat in a cool basement. And other things such as potatoes would be put in the ground. A layer of potatoes, straw, potatoes, beets, and fruits would be all put into the same hold. And so forth. And another part of preservation was fermentation and that was like making sauerkraut: And that's what they did to the cabbage. And another form of preservation was by smoking. The sausage kielbasa, was smoked. And during the winter months it kept. And drying fruits and apples, and plums, mushrooms, all kinds of things. Canning in those days was good. The majority of it was canned."
A. Could you tell me some of the games you played then when you were a boy?
"W. Well, the main games were baseball and football for the boys and the girls would play jacks and we kept away from the girls as much as possible."
"A. Could you mention some of the foods that you might have had on the special occasions such as Easter, or Christmas?"
W. The traditional foods were reserved for the Sundays and holidays. Fish was for the fasting days friday.
A. Did peddlers come to your town and sell their things?
"W. Peddlers? Well, yes they did."
A. When you worked in the mines did you get along with everyone? And did everyone get along with each other?
"W. Oh yes, they were all good. There was quite a fraternity between the peoples of the neighborhood. The newer immigration was certainly mistreated by the established majority. In Europe they might have learned to hate each other but here they began to like and learned to live with one another."
A. Did anyone else live with you and your parents besides your immediate family? Such as grandparents or boarders?
"W. Yes, we were a home for all my fathers brothers and all his brothers' friends. And the same prevailed for my mothers side. My mother not only had to take care of the needs of the family but she had to take care of the needs of these men. She did a lot of hard work. She got up early and she had a garden to take care of."
A. Were there any boarding houses?
W. There was no such thing as a boarding house. They were the half boarding houses and full boarding houses. The half were the ones that you could only get an evening meal and the full were all the time.
A. Were most of the clothing made or bought?
W. My mother made most of the clothing. From old flour sacks or sugar sacks. And I know some of my under garments were made from flour sacks and sugar sacks. And my mother had a second hand sewing machine and she made quite a bit of clothing on that machine.
A. What kind of social events did the church provide?
W. All kinds. They had bazaars and things and transportation was only by street car or if you walked. And if your house was quite a distance the people wouldn't go out too far. But then the picnics came into being about 1920's. They would also have dances.
A. Did the Ukrainians sing much?
"W. Yes, they did after the dancing they would congregate and go home and sing. When they started to dance on a Saturday they would go and go and go. Until the last street car would come. We had a good time."
A. What were some of the things that they used to sing about?
"W. They would sing about pastoral things and love and all of that and of course there was patriotic songs and there were mournful songs, And then if you notice the low tones in the songs."
A. Were there any newspapers that were around here that were Ukrainian?
"W. Yes, I was one of the few fortunate people that had a private tutor in Ukrainian."
"A. Being that your parents were from the Ukraine do you find it difficult that you are living in two different worlds, two different cultures?"
"W. Yes, in the beginning it was confusing. Even in High School we had inferiority complexes. And then when I went to college it was difficult for me to realize how some people had so much wealth. And then I realized that there was class distinction."
A. You felt the pressure then from other people?
"W. Yes, I did. But as you grow older they learned not to be so narrow minded, and I learned that there was not to the people of America than n what I had seen. I think the depression cemented us together much more than we realized."
