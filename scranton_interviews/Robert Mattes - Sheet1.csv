A. - Angela Vauter - interviewer
R. - Mr. Robert Mattes â€“ interviewee Pennsylvania Dutch

"A. This is an interview with Mr. Robert Mattes, he was employed by the Hudson coal company. And its' august 19, 1973. Would you tell me alittle bit about your job when you worked at the coal company?"
"R. Well, honey, back in the 20's I had been at the Olyphant colliery for two or three years doing clerical work, in the office. Then I ventured forth on a job of my own. That went broke in the depression period. And finally returned to the Hudson coal company in 1940. And I joined the chief surgeon at the Scranton office on Wyoming avenue. As his secretary. And I was very happy there until 1961, when we all got thrown out in the street. And the Hudson coal company was sold to the Gleen Alden company. And there was no more job. Then I came here to the historical society, where my sister was employed. And I took on what was called a water boy because I knew nothing. And as this is to deal with the coal company and how the impact of the coal company of the city, on the economy in the past 50 years."
A. Can you tell me something about the attitude of the employers in relation to the people that were employed there?
"R. Well, for one thing the Hudson coal company was pretty good to their employees and to their business. In office work., in payroll work and accounting work. And they hired us on a monthly basis. And if by any chance you had a sick spell you were never docked. My union would try to organize us in our office. But we refused. If at any time we could be laid off at a moment's notice. On our salaried forms we had some life insurance and blue cross and blue shield protection. And the salary. Which was not a lot but was good for those times. But we didn't join the union because they didn't have any particular things for us."
A. Who was John Lewis?
"R. He was the united mine workers president. Following shortly after Jonny Mitthell. He was a powerful man and a powerful labor. But nevertheless, he was oversellous in the cause of the United mine workers. Now a miner making about 18 dollars a day, was a lot better off when he was doing 4 days a week. Maybe five days if possible. Then he was at 27 dollars a day when he was working for two days. And this is what they finally came down to, this sort of thing. After WWII these pipeline factories came through, and what to do with these plants after WWII, shall we put them in mothballs or tear them down, or sell them to the government, or the oil companies."
A. How did that happen?
"R. Well, there was a small lease holder, down at Port Griffith. who had a lease for mining coal. And they were very close to the river, and there was a fine line drawn there and the river came to meet the mines, but the company that was pretty greedy decided to go out under the river anyhow, and they concealed this from the mine inspectors, and it didn't show up until about 6 months later. When the river actually broke through. There were 12 men that never came out. The government stepped in to help the water be pumped out. Well, they never got this hole entirely closed."
A. Did this ever happen before the Hudson mining company that they were digging too close to the river?
"R. Well, it never happened to our company because we were never in that situation. It was land that was leased to the smaller company. They would have been all right if they would have stayed away from the river. And that was the end of the mining for that area, because there was so much water."
A. Were there any other mine caves that they were responsible for?
"R. Yes, every coal company had troubles of their own."
A. What were the usual reasons for the cave-ins'?
"R. This gentlemen that I cant' remember his name (Mr. James Pierce) has told the fact that as the coal was being mined in the latter century, we mined where we could find the easiest coal. And they went on the area that was horizontal. And if you jine in a certain vein, you may find another vein down below it. So you had one above the other or one below the other. So when you mined the veins out, you try to leave the pillars in place so that a cave in would not occur But people went into the mining business the way that they wanted so that you have a pillar here and a pillar there and it wasn't a very good system. And that's why you had the danger. I have never mined any coal. I did work as a mechanic, on the maintenance force."
A. What was the difference between chestnut coal and pea coal?
R. Just the size. Size had a great deal to do with the burning of coal.
A. Where was the Hudson coal companies' main collieries?
"R. We had a great deal of business in New England and the New York States. Our people down in Mt. Carmel, when they were working we were sending it to the New England states. But we were getting out 14 to 16 cars of coal a day. And most of it went to New England."
A. Where did most of the people around here buy their coal?
"R. Around here usually from the dealers in the immediate region, when were more or less truckers rather than coal dealers. And they went to the consumers coal company or the Wyoming coal company."
A. We were talking about mine cave ins' if a mine caved in on a street or where a house was did the coal company compensate for what had happened?
"R. There was a terrific amount of agitation about that back in the 20's and 30's and we had a great deal of trouble over in Hyde Park. And there was a funeral director in Hyde Park, and he was a colorful politician got together a group of people that were the Surface Protective Association, and they in turn lobbied with the legislature against the cavins, and there was a certain law, called the cut-throat law. Which said that the company could sell to you property that was on the surface for your home, retain the mineral rights below and that they were not responsible for anything that was to happen below or to your house. And this was what we were trying to correct. And John Durkin was finally the mayor of Scranton, and he got two bills passed by the Pa. Legislature, But the coal companies were too big for them. But then the Hudson coal company and others realized that they had to help the people that they were hurting, their homes etc. Well, they organized a company of men, masons, and carpenters that would go around and repair the homes or cellar walls or whatever to make them suitable."
A. Did they ever encourage immigration for the coal mines?
"R. In the immediate region I don't know. It's a matter of historic record. In the Hazleton area, where practically all the mining was controlled by 3 or 4 powerful families there which had a breaker here and there. And if the men who were then trying to organize in a group to get some pressure on the operators, if they got too strong in their organization demanding for pay that was too high, then it was recorded that; they had procurriers in Poland inducing men to come to that area, and paying their way over on the ship to get them here. Because they were ignorant of business matters. Strong and willing to work. And maybe from being on the siol and not having much money in Poland, they felt it necessary. Then the regular workers were laid off. And this is what happened in the Lattimer struggle."
A. Did you ever know anything about the coal and Iron police?
"R. Yes, they were at times, when it seemed that trouble was threatening the town or"
"region and the coal companies would give them clubs and guns and a certain elementary training in policing. This went on right up until our own century. But we used to pay in cash to men. And we went around to various spots around the colliery, and watched for the men."
A. Were they feared by the people?
"R. In the early days of the century they were. But they are respected, and maybe then they were pretty loose in their handling. And they feared nobody."
A. Did they try to stop Union meetings and the unions from being formed? Like around the 1902 strike?
"R. This was the idea, they were to try to break up dissatisfied people in neighborhood."
"groups. And these people were in the back of saloons and so forth. Which was the only meeting places that these men had. And then if some stool pigeon said something, then they were there that night. And eventually they were hated in those times."
A. When Mitchell had that strike in 1902 did that sort of break up the coal and iron police?
"R. Well, I think that again there was a security patrol, at times, and this was not with the idea of being quarrelsome, and I think that they had more trouble with the soft coal people than you did with the others, in that time and place."
"A. Where did they get their first doctors and nurses, in the Moses Taylor Hospital?"
"R. Yes, they were paid by the coal company, and they had to be. There was no other provision."
A. Was this compensation set up by the state to be mandatory for the company to have?
"R. Yes, if they accepted the status of a self-insured company. Otherwise, a company that employed 2,000 men you payed a stock company that carried company insurance, and you pay so much a head for certain time, and we paid probably employed 7,500 men at the time, that this was put under way And instead of paying this, we decided to set up the program with the Commonwealth of Pa., and then we became a insurance company."
A. So that way you could just see if the men needed mandatory compensation.
"R. Right, we then had our own surgeons that we would pay. And we had surgeons in the field. Looking after different mines."
A. Were there any company houses or company stores?
"R. Yes, we had two streets at least of company houses. We had houses almost at every colliery for the people to rent at a very very low price. And then after 1902 we left a lot of the houses to the people because the mines were closing."
A. What do you mean by a mine patch?
"R. Well this was called a patch where people lived in a mining houses, the houses provided by the coal company. Transportation was poor in those days, So these people that worked for the company, the houses were very close to the colliery so that they would have not very far to walk."
A. Were most of these people grouped together for their own ethnic group?
"R. I would assume so, because they were very clannish. And you just didn't like living next to an Italian if you were a Polish person. So there were always the segregated sections of town. It was intolerable for a catholic girl to marry a protestant boy. That was amazing, now it has changed. How liberal this may be now I'm not sure."
"A. During these early years in Scranton, who were the major political leaders? Was there any special ethnic group that led the pack?"
"R. Well, it's hard to say, through the early part of the century it was mostly those like of those of the first families. Or the coal barren type. And then that stared to wear off. A German man. He was a wonderful influence."
A. You mentioned the coal people (?) did they have a lot to do with the political influences?
R. They rather controlled the politics of the region up until the 20's and then we started to get some common people. Later on we started to get the representation of all the people.
"A. After awhile the ethnics used to bring in their own friends into the politics, and they would be able to say that they were as good as they were?"
R. Yes.
"A. What were the ages of some of the boys that went into the mines in the beginning, or for their first time?"
"R. They went into work just as soon as they could hold their heads up and look alive. And they wanted to work in the breakers, so they picked slate. In those days we were bining better coal, so the work wasn't so hard."
A. What was their next job after picking slate?
R. If they could and they grew they would go into the mines.
A. What do they mean by working papers?
R. A man could be a laborer working under the direction of a miner. But he never fired any dynamite or powder. You had to have those papers under state law go show that you could handle the dynamite. And then you could qualify as a miner. But you couldn't be a miner until then.
A. Was this the highest job you could get including pay in the mines?
"R. Well, you could become a sectional foreman perhaps. And you controlled the mines or laborers under you. If you could handle it. But if you were a miner you were doing pretty well. After the price got good. And you got payed on piece work the more you got done the more you got paid."

Thank you. ...... the end.
