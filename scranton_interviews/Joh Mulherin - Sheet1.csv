Scranton Project Tapes Tape # 18 Side one
"Summer, 1973"
E.- John L. Earl - interviewer
"M.- Mr. John Mulherin - interviewee 2nd generation, Irish."

"E. Today we are interviewing Mr. John Mulherin, of 29-D Park Gardens, he is 2nd generation Irish. Mr. Mulherin we talked before, but not on the tape. We talked about the mining stories and miners before could you tell us about the Keg fund story?"
"M. In the early days of the anthracite industries. There was no provision for workmen's compensation. Or other benefits, as a result if a miner was hurt or killed, there was no benefits to himself or his family, there was no medical care or funeral services care. They had no resources to fall back on so there was a real hardship in the mines, and to us the mine workers banded together and they helped their fellow Brothers in times of emergency. And one of these funds was the Keg' fund. The miners had to purchase kegs from the company, they were kegs of powder, and these kegs carried a refund, and when they were to be returned there was a small refund. And the idea was to put these kegs into a fund, the returned keg funds, and this money was put into this fund and given out at the proper time. In addition to this refund of kegs, they also help fund raising affairs, and an excursion or picnic."
E. Did that amount to a lot of money?
"M. No not very much, I read something once that from the keg fund a miner's widow was given 30 dollars, but even still that was a great help in those days. And in many instances the widow and the children, landed up in the poor houses if they didn't have the money. The widow would work and the children would work also."
E. You mentioned to me that this anthracite region was instrumental in starting a hospital.
"M. As I said before the mine operators had no provisions for the miners, consequently, all they did was to transport the miner to his home and leave him there for better or for worse. Conditions were so bad that many mine workers if they recovered from their injuries they succumbed to lack of treatment. And some of the fellow mine workers rescue them, they did not have the ability to know what was wrong with the hurt miner and, therefore, at times would complicate their injuries. And make them worse. The conditions were so terrible, that Dr. named Benjamine Troup, organized a hospital that was a home converted into a medical office. And the purpose of it was to provide the hospital care that the miners needed. Actually it was taken over by the state, and it became a general state hospital."
"E. You mentioned that the people were ignorant of first aid, weren't they given a small course on first aid?"
"M. Well, Dr. Shields of Germany, is credited with having established the first aid program  along with the red cross. He was a general practitioner. And he was appalled by the extensive injuries from the mines of the miners. So he tried to show them the proper way to treat these people. He made arrangements with the operating companies in Germany and they organized mine(first aid) to avoid these injuries. It was a success right from the start. And eventually throughout the country, this spread."
E. I don't suppose any interview with an Irish miner would be complete without the mention of the Molly McGuires. Could you shed some more light on that?
"M. Well, the Molly McGuires as they existed was started by _____ Charlie McCarthy_____. And they centered their activities in the lower anthracite region. In the vicinity of Pottsville. Largely in Schuylkill county. About in the 1870's. There was a man named Frank B. Gowin, who headed the Philadelphia and Reading coal and iron com. It was a subsidiary of the P&R. railroad. They owned & large anthracite deposits. And the operators were ____ of their ______, and the working conditions were terrible and the men would work from daylight to dusk six days a week, and They would owe the company money. Because they were forced to trade at company owned stores. And the prices were exceeding the earnings of men. And the Molly McGuries were largely of Irish descent. And the second wave of workers in the anthracite region. And the owners were largely English, and the Welsh became the mine bosses and business men. And we were the lowercase workers. And if the market conditions were poor the mines were shut down. They had shelter in company owned houses. And when the men tried to organize for them to get better jobs, and conditions, the company opposed such organizations. And the workers caused some strikes. The men would have no resources to fall back on, and the company shut off credit in the company stores, and sometimes when the going got rough the company would shut the men out from the company owned houses. The conditions were such that the fertile field of men struck back, at their pursecuters, There are a number of slayings of mine bosses, and the Molly McGuries were blamed for this. But the operators always thought that the Molly McGuries were union organizations, but despite their efforts there was no connection between such and the mine union organizers. Some may have been members of both but they were not related....................... Mr. Gowin, who was a lawyer, he hired the pinckerton company to infiltrate the Molly McGuries, and to bring about their downfall. There was a native American/Irish named James McFarlin. who was detected by the agency. And he was the instigator of some of the actions, so they claimed. And this resulted in the arrest of some of the mine workers. And their subsequent trial. The ultimate result, was that the 20 men from the was Molly McGuires, that was the accused of these killings and actions were hanged and convicted. 10 of them in one day. Gowins faith was interesting. The Philadelphia Coal and Iron company fell upon financial evil days, and Gowin lost his job as the head of the company, and apparently his activities to the Molly McGuires prayed on his mind, and in 1889 he shot himself to death in a hotel room in Washington, Friday the 13th of December. He didn't die a poor man. he left his estate of 3 or 4 hundred thousand. And that was quite sizeable."
E. Was there any reason that was given why he committee suiside?
M. No just despondency. There wasn't harmony in his family according to the stories. Of course the Molly McGuires said that it was retribution for his dastardly deeds.
"E. Where did the word ""Molly McGuires"" come from?"
"M. A group in Ireland, that was named after a woman, who I understand who was in act of opposing the land grabs to the British, who occupied Ireland. And she was supposedly the leader of the rebels. Of course they were patriots in the eyes of the Irish."
E. How long were the Molly McGuires?
M. Well I didn't know how many it was supposed to be a secret society. And it was in the lower end of Luzerne county; but it never had many adherents... There were some reports of the Molly McGuires in Scranton etc.
E. Did you see the movie? What did you think?
"M. I liked the it but it was strictly a movie, focusing on one character and some scenes were good. And a man by the name of Jack Kehoe, who was from Pottsville."
E. I interviewed a man that said that the KKK was trying to establish a party here. Do you know anything about that?
"M. There was but before that there was a serious attempt to establish the IWW, they were called the Wobblies. They had their origin in the west. I think that a marshall took a raid into one of their meetings. But they never took over any of the mine region. As far as the KKK was concerned they were opened in these counties. Ordinarily they were strong in the rural areas but for some reason they got some strength. And I recall a reporter 1926 interviewing that there was going to be a KKK parade in Scranton on a Saturday afternoon. I know that there was a racket, and there was a fellow that was later a Scranton newspaper reporter for the Scranton paper, but he was at one time the press agent for the KKK, and the paper that I worked for was a Sunday paper. And the KKK would conduct their meetings on a Saturday night. And this guy would give us a report as to where their meeting would be and etc. And he was responsible for exposing the KKK in this area. And the head of the Klan was a pastor, without a church. But this press agent confided in us that they extracted a fixed amount of money from each member when they joined. And they would then give them the sheet. And then they divided the proceeds. But when they had their parade, there was an area in the 1000 block of North Scranton, here was a park called Sterges park, and they took over this vacant land, and they got 50¢ a head for this. And it was a shocking snow of bigotry in the Scranton streets. There were alot of marches in this. During that time there in 1925, there was a bitter election then between E.B. Jermyn, who was one of the pioneering families in Scranton, and Mike McCue, and he was the first democratic mayon. And he ........."
E. He was mayor during the 1936 strike wasn't he?
"M. Yes, E.B Jermyn."
E. Could you talk about the Unionization and the problems that the miners faced.
"M. The big strike of the united mine workers, was the first big strike was in 1900. And I believe that was the John Mitchell days, and march is the date of the windup of the 1900 strike in the Scranton region. And John Mitchedl was the leader of the strikes........................ It was just showing the strength of the mine workers. And another big one was the strike of 1902. And that was finally settled through the efforts of Theodore Rosevelt. Who appointed a commission to settle it. The Anthracite Board of Consolidation was formed out of that. ...... They heard and settled grievances. Perhaps the next notable strike was in 1925 and 1926. It was settled ån Lincoln's birthday in 1926."
E. I have heard an awful lot about the people that operated the mines around there was they as greedy as they say?
"M. In my estimation was most accurate. The facts tend to confirm it. There is nothing here in this region in Lackawanna county. It would be hard gopoint out one act of philanthropy on the part of an anthracite operator. Offhand I can't think of one thing that the operators left & posterity. Taking the natural resources and leaving nothing in return, and it is still plaging us today. And they took. Today they government is spending millions and millions of dollars to take care of the dumps. ...... The companies themselves never spent a dime to remedy the conditions.... Many of the areas that are caving today are the result of reckless mining by the miners."
E. What was the major problem?
M. Greed. It was out of town greed ownership. It was all absentee ownership.
E. Towards the latter part of mining there came to be what was known as contract mining. I guess that came about in the 1930's...
"M. Contract mining is not to be confused with contract miners. For a number of years miners were called contract miners because they were paid per bucket of coal, and out of these car loads of coal they had to pay the laborers that loaded the coal and their equipment and supplies. But in later years contract mining became to mean a coal company contracted with a individual to mine a section of an underground mine and then he in turn contracted miners, to work for him to dig the coal. The contract miner who became the subsidiary, hired miners to work and thereby made off his men. It became a very lucrative contract. The contract miner was liable for the wage increase also."
"E. I have a feeling that this could have lead to a serious amount of cutbacks, and corruption."
M. It did and it lead to bloodshed also. There were disagreements among the employees of the contract mines.
E. A lot of people say that we would make greater use of the coal that is here. Do you envision any return to the mining industry?
"M. Well, usually when anybody in national political life talking about coal they mean bituminous coal, rather then anthracite. There is no deep mine coal in Lackawanna county. It would cost huge sums of money to de-water the now existing mines. And then reinsitiute coal mining."
E. Wasn't there once a plan to dig a tunnell to the Chesapeak Bay....?
"M. Yes, before the so called dept to the industry. The water problem grew in emencity and cost and there was a plan designed by the U.S. Department of Interior. To build a tunnel which would carry the water, from the anthracite fields, and eventually wind up in the Susquehanna river below the conedequinna dam. The cost that time was astronomical, and that days figures, but it was all talk and no action. They said that the railroads had no foresight. And funny enough the railroads president always had his office in the rear end of the train. And saw what had gone by but didn't have the view from the front of the locomotive. The same thing can be said of the anthracite community. No foresight but just highsight."
E. could you talk about the tools that were used in those days. And you mentioned fossils.
"M. Well, it was a common occurrence for a miner in the mines to come across fossils, and when they would notice them, they would extricate them and bring the bigger pieces to the surface. My father brought home a fossil. I jusee it was a prehistoric fish. It was about 2 feet and about 6inches across. But the vertebrae was very visible, and it was around the home for a good many of years and the price got broken and we saved the pieces, but I don't know what happened then. But they were very common so they weren't really saved."
E. How about the Knox mine disaster?
"M. I have some personal memories about that but I hesitate to go into any of the details. It was a tragedy, because 9 or 10 men lost their lives. It was a bitter coal winter night, and they were trying to save the men. It was just a hole in the ground and by the susquehanna river. The river broke into the walls, and the men in the mines at the time, were killed. The eventually result of this was the flooding of large, operating deep mines south of there. And put them out of business."
"E. The last time that we talked we talked about a man , Guss Lippie, ....."
"M. Guss Lippie was the president of a District 1 UMW previously owned district. I think that he was one of the outstanding presidents of district one. He had a tragic close to his career. But his activities, on behalf of district one and the entire region, he hasn't' been given the credit he is due. But he was largely responsible for one number of improvements and in contractual relations."
"E. One final area is to look at the ethnic groups, that not only worked in the mines but lived in the region. Do you have any stories of a particular ethnic group, or anything about prejudice."
"M. The wave of immigrants was English, Welsh, Irish, and the eastern europeans, Polish, Slovak Ukrainian Gelicians. The Molly McGuries was an off shoot of one of those waves. And oppression of the new comers to the fields of course the anthracite operators always had the benefit, of labor supply to exceed the demand. Consequently they were paid the lowest amount possible. As all the Irish and Welsh were mistreated by the English so the Europeans were treated. The Italians they came in a wave too. But they in turn suffered the indignities of the new country. Perhaps the language too was a factor. But there wasn't one ethnic group that suffered exclusively........"
E. But now you have groups that are taking over............
M. But this has just started........................
"E. Just statistically the Italians were the last ones here, according the criteria they have followed the other ethnic groups."
