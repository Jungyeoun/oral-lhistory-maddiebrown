I was in business, till 1965. Then I quit because, ..first of all I couldn't make it go because stuff was too high, and besides...we didn't have much customers, they're all driving to the chain stores. So I had to give it up because I was over 65 then."

"LG: Oh, like the late '30s to...the late '30s it started to dwindle down."
B: Why were they leaving in the late '30s?
"LG: Thirty-eight, '39, ‘40."

"B:Even though there was work in the mines, they didn't want it?"
LG: Yes. You know the young generation....
MG: The young generation started moving up.
"LG: Young generation didn't want to work in the mines because they got this black lung you know, dust. The girls they were getting out too."

You see, the poorest families in all that had 5 or 6 children, 3 of those girls probably worked in New York, head nurses or something like that. I give them credit for that because they were born and brought up in a poor area and they made something out of themselves."
"B: What was Alden, was that a little town?"
LG: That's a little patch beyond the creek _________ Nanticoke. And Waterly.
B: Were these patches poor?

"B: Somebody told me one time that when the mines closed, you know they lost a lot of jobs in this area. But the reason that there were no other jobs or ng ather companies that came into the area was that the coal companies for years prevented it. They wouldn't let other companies come in here and establish factories or plants because they wanted to keep taxes low and they wanted to keep the work force just warking in the mines."
GLOWAKI 21
"LG: You know, I tell you...."

Then they would call the undertaker and have him take the body and embalm them and leave them in the house, and bury them.

"B: Now, the people, some people have complained that the coal companies when a man was injured in the mines or killed, the body was just brought by mules, by a wagon and dumped at the home or dumped on a porch."
"MG: Either on the porch...no, they wouldn't do it, not that I know of, not on the porch. They would take them in the house. But they did have mules and a wagon. A covered wagon they'd bring them in. When you'd see that wagoncoming you knew somebody was killed in the mines."
