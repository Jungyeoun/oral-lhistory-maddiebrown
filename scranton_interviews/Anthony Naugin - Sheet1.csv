And when the second world war came along I was too old. I was lucky."

"A.N. They were there, but I don't remember them having any trouble with them."
"J.E. One person once described them to me as being taken from the worst segment of the population, the coal and iron police."

"A.N. Well, I thought one job would be easier than the other. The Grass is greener on the other side."
J.E. Was there a lot of that the miners changing?
"A.N. The miners didn't change; it was the transportation that changed. When they got to be a certified miner they stayed there. In the lesser jobs there was a lot of change they wouldn't like the miner, or they wanted to go with somebody else who they thought was a better friend."
J.E. So there was a lot of that?
"A.N. Oh, yea."
J.E. So you changed a lot in the transportation end of it.
"A.N. Yea, I changed a lot, and when I hit the Hudson Coal company I stayed there for awhile, for about 40 years. And that was as an assistant section chief. And I worked as a company man, and there was differed work almost every day. One day you'd be transportation and the other you'd be hepping track layer or helping the timber man. Or you yiet went cleaning the roads. Everything in general."
"J.E. How were conditions in the mines, were they really as often they are painted?"
A.N. Well some I wouldn't say that they were all bad.
J.E. Were the bosses often the Simon Legree that is foten seen?
"A.N. They were there to get their production outs and they had to do it maybe harder than the others, and if you didn't get your production out then the other fella would have to answer to the other fella, and if the other fella didn't get his production out he'd have to go to the hiteman., see it was always carried up."
J.E. So they kept their eye on you all the way up.
A.N. The underdog had to eat it all up.
J.E. Was it a dangerous position?
A.N. It was always dangerous.
J.E. did you ever have any close calls with yourself?
"A.N. Well I got squeezed in here, it would have been worse but I seen it coming and I got out in time. I jumped up."
J.E. What was this a car.
"A.N. Well, it was a triple car with a motor. And it just skinned me. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, it was ripped in there than I thought. Well that was the worst of any of them."
J.E. Any explosion?
"A.N. No I never had any. I had a fella that was under me that had a very bad accident. I don't know how he is living today, and he is still living to today. And that happened 20 years ago. He got hit with a blast and it drove him from here to past that wall. And he is living today. He was in the hospital for 4 days and didnt' know nothing. They left him laying there."
J.E. What was it an explosion?
"A.N. Yea, an explosion - he was preparing a fire for blasting and he was connecting up a certain wire and when these two wires met boom! The wires down the road must have been touching something,."
J.E. Any other stories you can think of?
"A.N. Well, I helped get a fella out from under a cave in. We went in this day and the motor men went up to pull the car out of the place, and as he was looking up at the roof one of the laborers was behind the car waiting for the motorman to pull out. and before he pulled out the thing came out and caught this poor laborer in there so then we had to gather men to clean that fall away from there. So when it was my turn to clean the fall away, when I went down to pick up the first rock I see: something black, and I gave a yell that scared me, and I shook like a leaf so they took me down along the road to cool me off, and after I cooled off I went back to help them get him out. It struct me too quick to see him there. He was dead. There was tons and tons of rock on him. And there was another fella that there was what they call a saddle that came down from the roof, and this squashed him. The saddle was like a big rock with a hump on it, this came down from the roof and you think its a good roof but it comes out of there like grease."
J.E. And other dangerous examples? It was a dangerous job.
"A.N. It was a dangerous job every step you took, you considered it dangerous work. Sure there was a time when we worked in the Clark vein, I was laboring at the time and the miner that I was with. We were along side of each other and we couldn't see each other for the dust that was between us. There was too much dust in the place."
J.E. Did you get it in your lungs and all that?
"A.N. Yea, but thank god that I don't drink and smoke. That's why I look as good as I am. My poor miners' is dead and gone. He was a younger man than I was."
J.E. From the black Lung?
A.N. Yes.
"J.E. I don't understand why would drinking, I could understand smoking."
A.N. I don't know. You take a man that has black lung and the first time that he coughs he gets a cigarette. Now what does he do that for? It's just hurting him more.
"J.E. How about the relation that was between the miners, you say that some of them got along you say that yourminer was your immediate boss when you were a laborer wasn't he?"
"A.N. Yes, you know that some times the miners would make you all the coal that you could use for your shift and they'd sit down and you would have to load it up."
J.E. Would they just sit there for the rest of the day?
"A.N. Well, if you had a good miner he would help you, but some of them would do that. There was others that would say that is your job do it."
J.E. Did you get paid piece work or did you get paid hourly?
"A.N. Some jobs were piece work and others were days. You take miners, they would get paid by peice work, by the yardage and by the car. The cars that were loaded and the amount of yardage that they make in the day, or in the two weeks."
J.E. Inside the mine how many yards did they do in cubic yards or in length?
"A.N. Well it was in length, or in cubic."
J.E. Was the company finicky about how much was coal and how much was late?
"A.N. Yes, and you got docked that much."
"J.E. What were the criteria, a certain amount of rock has to get into it, how much did they allow?"
A.N. Well I don't know. They used to allow something like 400 lbs. of rock near 2 1/2 or 3 tons of coal.
J.E. Is that what a car would hold?
"A.N. Yea, well 3 tons, some were 4 ton car."
J.E. How many cars did you load in a day?
"A.N. Well when we hand loaded it was about 5 to 6 cars a day. And then there were, then mechanical works came in and long walls came in; there was no amount then because they used to be a gang of about 20 - 25 men on it."
"J.E. That wasn't piece work then, was it?"
"A.N. No then that was hourly. But then the fella that was responsible for that long wall, that is, the contractor, he got paid by the car."
J.E. Was mechanization a big help?
A.N. It got the coal out. It got it out much better.
J.E. Was there any thought about how you might be undermining the cities?
A.N. Well that was up to the section foreman. They just knew where they were mining. And wherevever it was reserved they couldn't take that. But I suppose that's how they got into a lot of caves.
J.E. Were there any cave gangs around here?
A.N. Well they did have them. This house was fixed by a cave gang.
"J.E. Could you describe them, tell us what they were like?"
"A.N. Well, they had to raise the house up two cement blocks, that's, 16 inches. And then they put the blocks right up on top of the wall, and then that's it and they plastered the walls where it was cracked. They didn't do a perfect job because it was under-skilled labor."
J.E. But it was free?
"A.N. It was free. And if you were a friend, in politics, you got your house done much quicker done up."
"J.E. These cave gangs, what nationality were they?"
"A.N. They were mostly Italian, because they were a more masonry workers."
After wards.................................
"A.N. Her brother worked with me riding rope, and we were pulling up out of a place where it was kinda curvey, and hilly and along side of it there was a lot of coal pile that the doors were open; and you know they throw them on the side. And I was what they called the bell tender, well I gave the bell for the engineer to pull it right through and put a lot of steam on because we couldn't get a good start. and you know when this fella was getting on the trip he kinda of fell and hit the wires and crossed the wires and the engineer stopped his trip and when I went back to look at him; there he was laying across the track, in between the two cars and if it wasn't , if that trip had kept going well he would have been a dead duck. The cars would have gone over him. He just through his hands back across the wires and when he did that he stopped the trip. I'll never forget that as long as I live. and this is Mrs. Bartus brother-in-law. We must have worked together for about 5 year"
