INTERVIEWEE: EDWARD LUTCHKO -A
"Q – Today we are interviewing Mr. Edward Lutchko. We are here at 238 Bellman Street in Throop. Mr. Lutchko is a second generation Ukrainian, Mr. Lutchko your father was born in the Ukrainian section of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and he came over in the 1880's. This was before you were born or he was married. Did he ever talk about why he came over?"
A - In those days in the old country when you was 19 years old you had to go into the army. And he didn't want to be drafted. So he went to America.
Q - Where did he go to in America?
"A - Down by Plymouth, Pennsylvania. And then from there he got a job on the railroad, in Altoona. My mother kept boarders and (-my-father-)... her husband got killed by a mine car, and my father was one of the boarders, and a few years later he married her. And then in 1902 he worked on the railroad all the time, and they were gone from ... they were building new track in Cresent, Pennsylvania. And we lived in Patton, that's right outside of Cresent. So my mother kept as high as 45 boarders, in a company shanty. And as the railroad got built they would put the shanty on the railroad and move up. Then I was born."
Q - Do you know why your father came to Plymouth?
"A - I don't believe he had any friends, he didn't know anybody."
Q - Did he have trouble with the language?
"A - The foreigners had it tough, there was alot of fighting between the Irish and, well, they used to call them greenies. So then my father always worked on the railroad and I was the only one that went into the mines. In 1912 I went picking slate. And I worked in two breakers, I was 13 years old. And then in Oxford I was running pumps and then from pumps I went to a loader boss in the breaker, I was 16 years old. Then from there I got my kidneys busted and I got knocked off a car with a break stick. And then in 1921 we got married, and then I went to soft coal. I worked on the railroad for my father."
Q - Where were you mining?
"A - I mined in Splanger, Pennsylvania. I started with my buddy on a Friday riding the shaft. And then on Monday 88, they were killed. And me and my buddy were the ones left. And then from there I went up to number 9 for a job. And I got two jobs that day; I started with the Pittsburgh Bridge and Ironworkers and I was with them for awhile. And then on the way we got a baby. She was born in Splanger. And that was 50 years now since she was born. And I was traveling shop and I left her behind with the baby. And I got sick of that, and I went to Detroit in 1923. And my brother kept writing to me. He was working in Ford and that was six dollars for sweeping and that was good pay. And I left a dollar-fifty work at the Ironworkers. It was a good job; you got a new broom in the morning and you hand them a stick in the afternoon... you just wore it out from sweeping. So, it didn't agree with me Detroit, or her, So I went home, And I worked in the mines. I worked for the Marvin mines. You name it I worked it. In 1954 they shut down and I quit. And I never done any thing since."
Q - When you came back from Detroit you were still in your 20's?
"A - Yes, I started in the Marvin mines. I worked in the Dixon mines a couple of years and then I went in the Marvin mines. From there I worked till '54; that's 19 years."
Q - Where did you live when you came back here?
"A - I lived in Bellview, and then we moved to Fellow Street. And then from there we moved up to Scranton Street. The bus ran at 6:00; if I missed it I was late for work, so I moved up here. That's to Throop. So we're 27 years here now. I'm here about 47 years in Throop, and I was raised in Bellview."
Q – You went back to the old country and lived there for 9 years.
"A - That's where I got my foot cut. Then we came back here. My father didn't know what to do from joy. We had a butcher shop in Europe, so my father's friend was going to America, and my father said wait for me. And he packed and left the family in Europe. Three boys, two girls and my mother. So my father left in the spring and my mother left in the fall. She sold everything, and came to Scranton, because my father was supposed to be there."
Q – You were 12?
"A - I was 9 when we came back,"
"Q – You remember you grew up in the Bellview neighborhood area, how was it living there?"
"A - You had to carry a baseball bat with you. That was the toughest town, Bellview and Kiser both."
Q - Was there different nationalities there?
"A - Well, they were just about all Irish. But then they started to sell out and then the Ukrainians started to buy. So now I don't believe there are two Irishmen in Bellview, And half of Bellview is burnt out and it's a mess."
Q- Did you have a tough time there because you were Ukrainian and they were Irish?
A - No. Already when we were grown there were three of us and when you hit one you had to hit the others. So it was civilized. When my father and his friends wanted to go to the hotel to get some beer three of them had to go.
Q- How was your house? Was there a garden?
"A - No. They managed to keep chickens, and pigs, ducks, and geese, and there was a little garden. But we were living pretty good."
Q - Did your father stay there or did he come back to Scranton to live?
A - Yes. He came back and worked on the railroad.
Q - They did well on the railroad financially?
"A - Well, they worked 10 hours a day and it was a dollar and 10 cents a day. Eleven cents an hour. That was in 1908 and I was already working on the railroad."
Q - How about the churches in the area?
"A - Yes, I went to the Greek Catholic Church, on 7th Street. And then from there they broke up and there was kickers and suckers and they built the kickers built a church up on Main Avenue. And it's still there. That was the National movement. And then in the mines it was good, I didn't have to worry about somebody breathing down my neck. And in the mines you was your own boss. You load your coal when you go in and load your coal. They used to call me'here he comes and there he goes' . . . I had so much work to do and then you were out"
Q - Do you have any stories about how you were almost hurt?
A-...
Q - Were you involved in any explosions?
"A - There was only one and that was down in Splanger Pennsylvania. There were 88 men killed and they were all with their sons. You could see them. They would have their faces in the dirt with their arms stretched over one another. They even tried to hide in boxes, to get away from the smoke that killed them, the black dam."
Q - When you worked in the mines did you belong to the union?
"A - In 1902 there was the biggest strike, but there was no trouble."
Q - Did any of your children go into the mines?
A - No. I have two boys and two girls. And out of my family I was the only one that went into the mines.
"Q - How about most of the people in the mines? Were they Welsh, Irish, different nationalities?"
"A - Oh, yea we even had niggers. There were all nationalities."
Q - How about the foreman?
A - They were different nationalities.They all worked themselves up.
Q - Thank you very much for all your help. Thank you.
