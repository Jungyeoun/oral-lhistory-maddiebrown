J.E. John L. Earl - interviewer
V.B. Victor Bartus - interviewee Lithuanian - 1st generation

"J.E. Today we are interviewing Mr. Victor A. Bartus who was born in Lepouniee, Lithuania. You were born in 1896, July the 19th. And you came to the United States when you were 13 years old, in 1909. You were born in Lithuania, you were 13 when you came over here. Can you remember what you did in Lithuania when you were a boy?"
"V.B. Well, I was a shepherd boy. I was a shepherd boy doing field work, watching pigs and cows."
J.E. You lived on a farm?
"V.B. Yea, on a farm."
J.E. Why did you come to the United States?
"V.B. Well, I came to the United States by my godmother; because my father was on the loose for 8 years. So my godmother, my mother's sister, took the privilege to bring us over, my mother and her brother, the three of us. On July 19, my birthday, I met my father, and he was surprised. He didn't even know I was coming. I met him in Mahanoy City."
J.E. Why did you come up to northeastern Pennsylvania. Was it because your father was here?
"V.B. Well, I worked in the Lehigh Valley - Reading Coal Company, until 1920. Then I got married, so I moved over here. And then I work in Stores Colliery until 1932, when they shut down, and I went to WPA. And then in 1942 I started to work in no. 2 shaft colliery. After 1944, I got sick and I was disqualified and then I asked the fireboss if he would give me a job outside the mines and he refused. So I went to the office and then I showed them the papers for 4 weeks, and I have to go to Hicksville, this and that, and take care of that. So I was kinda of scared. On August the 1st I applied for an application and on August the 3rd I got a letter. ""friend come to work"". So they took my fingerprints and my picture, and because during the war in those airplanes those B-29's. So I was surprised, that I'm not too old. And in 55 I got a job in the borough building, a janitor. And then in 57 a person was here to visit, and her husband was a policeman, and she was working in Hotel Casey, in Scranton. So they counted me in at Hotel Casey. And my wife couldn't exactly say the date and the month, but it was 57, and I worked until 61. After awhile when I was 65, it was too hard for me on the night shift, and it was terrible thing carrying wooden tables up to the 9th floor. And I set them up and braced them. So when I got to 65 I said enough! So I applied for social security. So now I'm on social security and I got blanklung, and I'm not poor and I'm not rich."
"J.E. Let's go back to when you were a boy, when you lived in Mahanoy City. How long did you live there?"
V.B. 12 years.
J.E. Did you go to work right away in the mines?
"V.B. No, It was a lucky thing. Schuylkill county, there was a law that you had to go to school 1 year. The thing is I was very lucky because if I go to the breaker the breaker boys are going to tell me something, I don't understand. I couldn't speak English. I can speak Polish, Russian, and Lithuanian. But the thing is it was a lucky break that in 1911, April the 8th. I started to pick slate in the Maple Hill colliery. It was $5.22 a week. For 10 hours and 6 days. They were dumping 2,000 cars in the breaker before they released the water, and then dust was all over the building. When I came home I looked like a nigger."
"J.E. Do you remember anything else about your work, how long did you pick slate?"
V.B. 2 years.
J.E. Did you get a raise in salary?
"V.B. Well, then I got $9.96 a week. I still worked 10 hours and six days a week."
"J.E. Did you move up the ladder of success, did you get any other positions?"
"V.B. Well, from a slate picker I was a fanboy, in the mines. And then from a fanboy to a nipper."
J.E. What did you do as a fanboy? What was that?
"V.B. To turn the fan, and I got to.... to. Well, when I was sixteen a fella took me up into the mines and they wanted me to be a mile driver. And in 1918 I was a laborer for 5 dollars and 50 cents a day. And then after a while, the fellas introduced me to get the miners papers. And then I got $7.50 a day."
"J.E. What did you have to do, I know that a laborer had to load the cars, were you paid just a straight salary? There was no piece work."
"V.B. It was $5.50 straight no matter how many cars you loaded. I came to here when I got married in 1920. I work up in Storres Colliery for $6.50 a week. And I had to do at least 6 a day. Well sure, if I don't do it how am I gonna feed the family. Years ago that was the situation. Only till 1926 I was a miner, and I was on my own."
J.E. What test did you have to take to be a miner?
"V.B. Oh, yes you had to go to the mine workers agency and get a test. You had to provide proof of your age, and you had to know what the work was in the mines. Of course I work in the mines as a fan boy and as a nipper and then as a mule driver."
J.E. What's a nipper?
"V.B. Oh, That was a boy that when the locomotives came in they took the cows out. And that's a nipper."
J.E. And then you drove the mules?
"V.B. Yes, I drove the mules. And then after that, I got a job as a laborer. And then from laboring I went to assistant miner. At $7.75 a day. In them days that was good money. Then I figure out that I'd go with the timberman, and put the timber up. So I learn about the timbering, and then after that, well when I came over here I took the job as a laborer, and for four years I load six car a day before I go home. And then In 1932 it closed down, and my tools is there. They wanted me to carrie, you know the slope that is down hill?"
J.E. No.
"V.B. From there I went to no. 2 shaft in Storres. I had to carry the tools on my back how many steps that I had to make it and there was 300 dollars worth of tools, and they wouldn't give you a cow if the laborer would bull it in. Baloney!!!"
J.E. That was the time of the depression?
V.B. Yea.
J.E. Did a lot of the mines close then?
"V.B. Well, I work on the floods, the WPA, all the coals in Throop I work all over the state. I was a jack hammer driller for the state."
"J.E. Do you remember the days when you worked in the mines, was it tough work was it hard, was it back breaking?"
"V.B. Well, the working is the way you act. The way you act, it's hard work, of course, but you're not going to kill yourself, I go in the morning at seven o'clock, and I don't go out until 3:30."
J.E. You were in the mines all that time?
"V.B. Yea, so I take care of the laborers, and the first thing that I do was to load the first car. And then load the other one, and then make room to drill a hole, So when the car is loaded, I push the car down into the rock. You pushed that down and then put the props up, and load that in the car..... then you laad the cars with some more coal. And then at 3:30 you go out, home."
J.E. How many cars did you make?
"V.B. It was $2.72 a day and I did four cars. It was dirty coal and I used to wash, the coal and I used to get lots and lots of coal, because the labor didn't market it. So it was mostly dirty work, to pick up all the coal. I tell you my friend for 7 years I struggle and I struggle and I thank the lord that I am still going."
J.E. How was it down there how was the air?
"V.B. Well, its up to you if you made it with the air it was all right. But if you néglect you get ""pheewt""!!! (dead)"
"J.E. How about the light, was it well lit down there?"
"V.B. Well, at first it was kind of light, kerosene lamps. If you neglect the course of air then you get ton one place in which I was working, that the air was going to the surface out of the vein. And I told the section forman, and he is to make a mask and then put this over your face. And then the coals to the other way. Well, you know what he did? He transferred me to the other place and then after I left he did the same thing that I told him. When you give advice to a section foreman they don't like that. Because they are supposed to know more than you are."
J.E. Did you have any problems with the section foremans were they nice people? Were the hard to get along with?
"V.B. Well, some of them were tough. But I could get along with them."
J.E. Your section chiefs who were they? What nationality were they?
"V.B. Well, the foreman was Welsh, and the fire boss was Slovak. But I work for all kinds of classes of people in the mines. I work there for years. But most of them were Welsh. The fire bosses were mostly Irish, and Slovaks sometimes."
J.E. Did you have any problems with the coal and iron police? Were they around
when you were there?
"V.B. No, I took care of myself, I just took my time."

J.E. Was there any jokes made?
V.B. As long as you did your job it was all right. If you had your mining papers
they didn't worry about who you were. They didn't care about that.
J.E. Can you remember what the neighborhood was like? Can you remember what the neighborhood was like when you were little and then when you moved here?
"V.B. For me there doesn't make any difference, I have friends everyplace I go, because I don't stick my nose into others peoples affairs."
"J.E. Can you remember what the houses were like? What was this neighborhood like, you moved up to Throop right after you got married, and you've been living here ever since. What were the people like?"

J.E. What was the longest you ever had to walk?
V.B. About an hour and a half. One way.
J.E. That means to get down in the mines at 7 o'clock you had to leave at five.
"V.B. There was a train and you had to go at six o'clock to the Lehigh Valley and it was 10¢ a fare. And if there wasn't any room you had to walk. And then you had to wait to 5 o'clock until the train comes and picks you up. And then when you quit at 3:30 you don't want to wait around, so you might as well keep on going."

"V.B. It was heated with coal. And in 1970 my wife got sick, so we went to the doctors, and I couldn't take care of her, and my brother-in-law came down and took care of her, and he made a mess out of it. So I had to put an extra coat on and I went down near the forest and get some wood, and I made a fire. 2 weeks later my son came from Old Forge to help me but I didn't want to make any trouble for them, because the house was warm. So I went down and got some more wood and: made a new fire, and I said now, that I have blacklung........ through the son of a bitch coal out of here so I don't have to worry about it. They took the ashes out and now the heat oil is steady in the house."
