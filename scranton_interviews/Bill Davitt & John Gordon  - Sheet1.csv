"Summer, 1973"
B. & J.G.- Mr. Bill Davitt & Mr. John Gordon - united mine workers interviewees
J.- John L. Earl - interviewer

"J. Today we are interviewing Mr. Bill Davitt and Mr. John Gordon, they are united mine workers. Mr. Davitt is an officer for the United Mine workers. And you ever work in the mines yourself?"
"B. No, never in the mines no."
J. How long have you been associated with the mines?
B. Since 1914. And I just started to work with the unions.
J. What were the conditions like in the mines when you started working?
"B. Well, I'll start with the breakers. It was the hardest work that a job was called on to do. I started with a 10 hour day at 6¢ an hour., and then I went to a 9 hour day. But they never started under the door, as it were, there were runners and drivers and motor runners, coal miners and laborers. And it wasn't easy, and in those days it was hand mining. There wasn't as much dust in the mines today as there was before. It was hard work and it took the best out of you."
J. In those days was the miner getting a fair shake? It was tough work but was he getting a fair wage at that time?
"B.No, I never got a fair pay in those days."
J.G. For the work that you did you didn't get a fair pay. I worked as an electrician 1926 and I was in the mines with they were doing away with all the mules and that stuff and they still weren't getting the pay. And it was slavery as far as the miners were concerned. And it was slavery when I left the mines.
J. When did you leave?
"J.G. 1968, or 1967 and they never got a fair shake. Well, as far as I'll say that they got their pay but it was hard work."
"J. The differende in mining when you were doing it with hand mining, how much did that increase the production getting the electricity in there?"
"J.G. Well, 3 times better."
J. But do you think that it increased your sallary?
"J.G. No, it didn't."
B. You always had to fight for what you got. And there was just a fixed money income and that's where it stayed. 1922 to 1925. And then we didn't even get it then we had to go back and work for it. And once they electrified the mines their profit tripled.
J. And that was more of the cause of black lung than anything else. Wasn't there anything done was it brought up as a health hazard?
"B. Well, lets put another thing in there alot of it was the miners fault. Not the miners fault indirectly, when the dust came out they could have waited and let it settle but they were always going. And they were getting paid on production if they didn't get anything out they didn't get paid a nickel. It was the system that made them that way. If they didn't do it they didn't get paid."
"J. What was expected of them, you say that they got paid for their production, what did they get paid."
"J.G. The hand mining was usually four hand cars and 2 men. And then when it became mechanical they could produce some more, and then when they didn't have another car they would give it to somebody else. And then they began to ask for another car, but since the marvin mine bought the mines, they could produce more."
J. Were there alot of layoffs?
"B. Some of the fellows couldn't take the layoff, there were alot. And some fellows couldn't stand the layoff and they would just go to another colliery."
J. There was a lot of shifting from one company to another?
B. Yes.
"J. How about safety, before and after electrification."
B. Well they did try with the jack hammer.
J. How about cave in's was there as much of that in the anthracite region?
J.G. Lots of cave in's and lots of falls.
"J. How about the union itself, could you give us an idea of what it was trying to do and when it began?"
"J.G. Well, if you could find John Mitchells' history he started back in the 1900's. As a matter of fact, I think that the Marvin local chapter was there since 1897. And that was local #151 in district 51."
J. This is district one?
"J.G. Yes, it was born right here. There were different districts, ...."
J. But you say that their UMW district started right here?
"J.G. yes, and there the UMW was started in 1902 and there were a presentation of awards, from Teddy Roosevelt. And there was then some striking."
"J. You mentioned that there was a certain amount, that anything that the anthracite miner wanted he had to do it by striking. Was this true of the industry?"
"B. Yes, it was from colliery to colliery."
J. Was it just as tough ản Western Pennsylvania as maybe in West Virginia?
"B. I don't know it would have been, we had our Co stores here. And the railroads just owned the mines. And they were broken up in the anti-trust suits."
J. Did you ever deal in collective bargaining yourself? What were the reasons?
"B. Well, they had all kinds of excuses. They had all kinds, they couldn't afford it, they couldn't do it, but we knew that they could."
J. They were saying these things but they were making a massive profit.
"B. Sure, look at the financial profit of the coal barons in the area."
"J. I have been told by several people that perhaps no greedier bunch of owners and operators and those who were in the northeastern part of Pa, that could be found. Most of them were absentee ownership. They couldn't give a damn about the area, they left...."
B. The only thing was the Mosses-Taylor hospital. And the Lacakwanna railroad made that. And that today has no connection today with coal. They took injury accidents and all kinds over to that hospital.
J. Do you remember the coal and Iron Police?
"B. Oh, yes. They were always here."
J. There were molly McGüires weren't there?
B. They were I suppose.
J. Wasn't there another union that was trying to take the place of the UMW?
B. That was in the early 30's.
J.G. Years ago you used to have to pay the union to do those things......... can I have an application.
B. One thing about the miners is that they stuck together.
"J. This is something that I have found out.. Down in the mines they were truly friends. I have been told that at various times there was some violence, do you recall any of that today?"
"B. There was a lot of violence, blasting of porches, beating of people. That was as late as the 30's. In the 30's there wasn't too many jobs."
"J. When the miners went ont strike, it was tough enough to make ends meet when you we were working, what did the miners do when they wer out on strike or when there was a layoff? How did they exist?"
B. The corner grocer was the one that saved him.
"J. How about rentals, how about there homes?"
B. Some of them carried them.
"J. I mean the businesses, the bands and thengs were they sympathetic towards the miners?"
B. ?
J. How about the churches did they help out at all?
"B. Yes, they were on the miners' side all the time."
J. What killed mining?
B. Mismanagement. If they had it today they have big business. There are millions of tons of coal just virgin coal around.
"J. Well, the water is a big problem isn't it?"
"B. Yes, they let it go. Back in the 30's they had a mine tunnel that was supposed to go down and empty into the Chesapeake bay. It cost so much that they just didn't do it. But now if they would do it it would cost even more."
J. Did moffit make its' own power?
B. They did for awhile....
"J. I have been told that the contract mines, they way that they did it in the 30's. It was a way to get around the mnions."
B. That was brought in here by the Cappolittie the Pa Goal Company. And he would hire the men the best way he could. And just signed the due bill. And if pay day came around and he didn't have it ready he would get a due bill with four x's on it. and sometimes they would have a due bill and they had x's on it and they would give withdraw because it was a good one.
J. How about the politicians in theis city were any of them sympathetic?
"B. Are you saying the state?.,,,, We had a lot of people that were nice."
"J. I have been told that when the Pa. State Police were made there were a lot of peolle that thought, that they were pro operators and then it turned out that they were eventually better than the coal and Iron police."
"B. I'll tell you a sotry, in 1922 when that strike occupied and prior to it the Hudson coal company, and the marvin colliley............(?)......"
J. Were the state police better than the coal and iron police?
"B. Yes, they were better but they were taught tool There were some nice ones but then there were some that..... They would come along with their horse and their club and wack you. If you were on strike you had to picket. We didn't have any trouble getting pickets,"
J. Could non-union workers work in the mines?
"B. No. As the 1930, workers laws they could not work, it was the condition of employment. There was a 7 hour day, and you had to be a member of the union to get these benefits. And there was a partial checkoff. And then in 1937 you had to get ........"
J. Mining started to go down in the 1940's?
B. It was going down in the 30's. Through the war and the last world war.
"J. Was there anyone to check on it, did the company keep track of how much you made in the mines?"
"B. Yes,.............................. We could see if you got paid right."
"J. But suppose the guy says that he mined 20 cars this week and the company says no you only did 18, was there a lot of that done?"
"B. There was a company check weighman and a union check weighman. In later they only got paid for the cars of coal, And for the timbering. But you have to fight like hell to get it. You have what they call better than average. And the Hudson coal had this. They load you 16 cars at 99¢ a car, and that was the average at that place. And then they have a commission, so when I ask them about it they said that it was the policy of the company........"
"J. In other works you had to make a lot of noise about it, in order to get paid. If you were a nice guy about it ..... they took advantage of you. Everyday of the week. Who made up the conciliation?"
B. One union one operator and one neutral. The umpire was a mutual man. But they both paid them. The union gave them so much and the company gave them so much. He was supposed to judge the case on its merit.
J. Did they give fair decisions in that port?
"B. Well, there was negotiated and signed agreements. Both sides signed it"
"J. I noticed that you were getting a lot of calls about the black lung, do you still help them out?"
"B. Sure, I helped a guy out last night, I asked him why did you wait so long, and he said that he thought he was dumb I guess."
J. Do they get anything?
B. They do from the day it is signed.....
J. But do they accept their own social security?
B. They will... As long as they can prove that they worked in the mines they should get it.
J. How long do you have to prove that you worked?
"B. At least 10 years, to qualify at least 10 years."
"J. We were talking about the energy crisis before and there is so much coal in this area.... do you really think that it might come back, the water is a problem but do you think that there is a possibility?"
B. No. Most of the experienced miners are old to work. Maybe soft coal..... sure they mine soft coal.
J. Where do they mine as far south as Alabama?
B. Huntsville and all that area....
J. You were always in their debt then weren't you? When did you get paid?
B. Every two weeks....
J. Was there things like family picnics
"B. Yes, yes. The union used to run them, not the company."
"J. Here is a phrase that I remember hearing, do you remember ""cave gangs""?"
B. They were people that were employed by the company to go around and repair damaged homes from the cave-ins. Sometimes the house used to have to be falling down before they would go and repair it. And sometimes there used to be the gas that would be around and kill some of the people.........
