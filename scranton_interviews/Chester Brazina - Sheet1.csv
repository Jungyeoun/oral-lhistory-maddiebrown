"Mr. Bodnar: This is April 15, 1981. My name is John Bodnar. I'm in Plymouth, Pennsylvania. I'm interviewing Chester Brazina..."
Mr. Brazina: That's right.
"Bodnar: Mr. Brazina, and we'll be talking about his life and work in this area of Pennsylvania, Mr. Brazina, will you tell me first of all where you were born and when?"
"Brazina: September 26, 1908 in Plymouth, PA. Bodnar: And will you tell me a little bit. about your family that you were born into - where your father worked, and what your mother did, and your brothers and sisters?"
"Brazina: Well, my mother was a housewife all her life. My father worked in the mines, my father was a miner. And, of course, my brother, he's a butcher. I was actually the only one that really worked in the mines. I finally had seven children - I was the oldest of seven children."
"Bodnar: All right, you were the oldest of seven children. Where was your father born?"
Brazina: In Plymouth. Bodnar: In Plymouth? And what about your mother?
Brazina: In Plymouth.
Bodnar: As well?
Brazina:That's right.
Bodnar: What was their ethnic background?
Brazina:Polish.
Bodnar: Were they Polish?
Brazina: Um hum.
Bodnar: So it was your grandfather that migrated to this country.
Brazina: About 1874.
"Bodnar: Where’d he come from, the German area of Poland?"
"Brazina: Austria, along the Austrian. Franz Joseph, the emperor Franz Joseph."
"Bodnar: Your grandfather, do you know what village he came from, or town?"
"Brazina: No, it was down in the southern part near the Czech border somewhere in the - what mountains are they? - Carpathian? Somewhere in that area, near the Czech border."
Bodnar: Did you ever know your grandfather?
"Brazina: Oh yeah, sure, you betcha."
"Bodnar: Do you know why he came to this country? Brazina: Like they all did at that time, there was nothing there, so they all came and migrated here. They worked in the coal mines, and that was it."
Bednar: Who’d your grandfather work for?
Brazina: The Lehigh and Wilkes-Barre Coal Company.
Bodnar: Was that the biggest company for the Plymouth area?
"Brazina: Yeah, that was it. They had the Lance _______ breaker, they had the Nottingham . breaker, they had the Number 12 and the Washington all-became ---- all of that, but at that Lehigh and Wilke"
Bodnar: Did your grandfather help your father get a job in the mines as well?
"Brazina: At that time, jobs were plentiful. You could quit one job in the morning and start somewhere in the afternoon, you know, night shift. Jobs were pretty plentiful during that time."
Bodnar: What was your father's name?
Brazina: Frankaus my fathers name.
Bodnar: He was born in Plymouth as well. Where did he work?
"Brazina: He worked at George F. Lee, he worked at the Washington Collier. He worked a little while in one place, then quit, then move to another place."
Bodnar: Why? Why would you quit?
"Brazina: Maybe conditions got so as that you couldn't stand them - you didn't like the boss or any number of reasons. Maybe the pay was better somewhere else, or the work was easier, or you had a friend came down, I'll get you a job where I'm working. It all tied in."
Bodnar: What did your father do? Was he a miner?
Brazina: Yes.
"Bodnar: How did he start out, though?"
"Brazina: His main occupation was the assistant manager in a grocery store, a small chain grocery store in town. But then the pay -with a bunch of children, 7 children, the pay was so small he had to get in the mines where the money was much better."
Bodnar: That was one of the best paying jobs around then?
"Brazina: At that time, yes."
"Bodnar: You're growing up in a family of 7 children. Do you have your own home, or do you rent somewhere?"
Brazina: I have my own home.
"Bodnar: Your father did, you mean. Brazina: Oh, my father. Yes, he did. He bought it from my mother's mother, my grandmother."
"Bodnar: You're the oldest one. Do you have to go out and help that family at all or support them, or work?"
Brazina: My mother and father are both deceased.
Bodnar: As a child.
"Brazina: Oh, as a child, at was circumstances because your father said if you want to continue on school you can, but then all your buddies went to work. They were going uptown with a dollar in their pocket and you didn't have any, so you said, well, the hell with this, I'm going to go get a job, and you did. So at 14 years old you went and got your working papers and got a job."
Bodnar: Doing what?
"Brazina: I worked in a coal breaker to begin with, the Kingston Coal Company. From there on, I went to Avondale, and Lee."
Bodnar: Why did you go up to Kingston?
"Brazina: Our tenant in our house was a foreman up there, assistant foreman. He got me the job."
Bodnar: You mean a tenant in the house. Did you have borders?
Brazina: No. It was a 3 family house.
Bodnar: And your father owned it? And you rented out to other families?
Brazina: Two other people.
"Bodnar: So the tenant was up there, and he got you in as what? As a breaker boy?"
Brazina: Yeah.
Bednar: Describe that to me. What did you do as a breaker boy?
"Brazina: Well, there were slate pickers, but he didn't start me that way. There were different occupations. There was shakers up where they dump the cars. Then there was the chute, where it would separate the sizes of coal. Then there was what they call the jigs, where the rock would be separated - a lot of the rock, but not all. Then the breaker boys were the last ones that would pick out the pieces of slag and rock or slate or whatever. I started out mostly as a shaker changer, a little better job than a slate picker."
Bodnar: Were they tough on you?
"Brazina: Oh no, Things weren't that bad at that time, in our time. They were years back, but not in our time."
"Bodnar: This is about 1922, right?"
"Brazina: Yeah, around that time."
Bodnar: Did you get that dollar in your pocket? Were you able to keep your money?
"Brazina: You brought your pay home, and then your mother gave you whatever, 50¢ or 754. Of course it cost a nickel to go to the movies, a nickel for a bag of candy, or so on, so expenses wasn't that great - unless you started smoking or chewing tobacco or something. Then of course you needed a little more spending money. But on the whole, you turned your pay in up to your parents."
Bodnar: How long did you work in the breaker?
"Brazina: I'd say maybe 2 years or so. Then I went to Avondale. There was a neighbor of ours was foreman at Avondale, and he got me a job outside which paid more money as outside labor. That was partly, well, it was a coal company."
Bodnar: It paid more than the breaker? 
Brazina: That's right.
Bodnar: What did you do as an outside laborer?
"Brazina: Hell (laughter), get you,"" put in help pipe fitters, you break down a ((lowkey?)), you help a chimneyman. General utility work."
"Bodnar: What do you mean, break down the ((lowkey?)) "
"Brazina: Well, if it was a steam ((lowkey?)), you used to take the rock out and the rod'd dump. Cars outside, well then you'd have to throw switches and block up the cars and hook them up and ((oil them?)), that's all."
Bodnar: Do you stay as an outside laborer for a long time?
Brazina: I tend head the shaft and then I went in the lamp shanty.
Bodnar: What was the lamp shanty?
"Brazina: Lamp room, where you cleaned the safety lamps, and so on for the next day and charge. I stayed there about 4 or 5 years. Then that wasn't enough money. I wanted more money, so I went to the Loomis as a laborer, loading coal in the mines."
"Bodnar: The Loomis is what, a breaker?"
"Brazina: No, it was a mine. The Loomis was the Loomis Collier."
Bodnar: This is Glen Olive
"Brazina: Yeah, around there."
"Bodnar: You're working around the mines then in the twenties when there was two strikes. There was one in '22 or '3, and there's another one in '25. Were you ever thrown out of work for any period of time then?"
"Brazina: Oh yeah, most of us."
Bodnar: What did you do?
"Brazina: We went up and found a coal hole, and carried coal out, and sold it to people. This is here you sustained yourself. Bodnar: What do you mean, you found a coal hole? Brazina: You went up in the mountain, and dug a hole, and found coal up there. Then you carried it out, cracked it, and then you sold it to business people along Main Street because there was no other source of coal. So you sold them the coal, and that's the way you ((lived?)) There was no Welfare, and there was no food stamps, there was no benefits of any kind. The fellow that in the region, it should be the small store keeper, because he was the guy that kept you on the book. Otherwise, you'd never won a stike here."
Bodnar: Explain that to me.
"Brazina: When you went to the store, you bought what you called on the book. You got your pay every two weeks, then you went and you paid. When a strike came, why, he just kept on taking on his book, and you didn't pay him until you started back on to work. But if he had demanded his money when it was due, then you couldn't have survived. So he is the real hero of the coal mines, the store keeper, the individual store keeper."
Bodnar: How did they survive?
"Brazina: Well, they always had a little more. When you was taking, I don't know. I wouldn't want to say for publication. Maybe they charge a little bit more than the chain stores did at that time, because they were only beginning. Then the chain stores like Mulleson, that became the _______, and they built up a little reserve of their own too. They helped. And some people work, and were paying their bills and that helped."
"Bodnar: In '25 did you do the same thing, did you go pick coal? Or did you ever leave the are to look for another job?"
"Brazina: Not at that time, no."
"Bodnar: A person 25, you'd still be a youngster, actually."
"Brazina: Yes. There's no reason to go anywhere, because you were staying home. So all you've done it helped out at home with whatever you need."
"Bodnar: At 14 years old you go into the breaker and then eventually work on the outside of the mines. What about your younger brothers and sisters? Tell me a little bit about what they did when they became 14, 15, 16 years old."
"Brazina: Well, they kept on going to school. They all graduated but me. I quit at eighth grade. Bodnar: And all the rest finished high school?"
"Brazina: Right. One went on to become a nurse, the youngest, the baby became a nurse. And of course the two other brothers were in the service during the war."
Bodnar: World War what?
"Brazina: II. They all went different directions, they didn't work in the mines. One brother went in temporary for a little while, but that was all. The other, he mostly followed store business, and he still has' his own store today."
Bodnar: What kind of store is that?
Brazina: Grocery store - butcher shop.
Bodnar: What was his name?
"Brazina: Frank, My father's And my sisters, they worked in local stores, five and dimes. That was about it."
Bodnar: How long did you stay at home? Until what age?
"Brazina: Well, I got married in 1929."
"Bodnar: OK, till you were about 21 then. Did you continue to contribute your wages to your family until that time?"
Brazina: Yes.
Bodnar: What did you do when you married? Where did you live then?
"Brazina: Well, there was 4 rooms in my mother's house and we lived there. We had furniture, and we lived there."
"Bodnar: People have told me, that I've talked to in this area, that during times of strike or hard times or crises such as funerals or even good times such as weddings, that people helped each other out a great deal, in terms of cooking for each other.... Is that true in this"
"Brazina: Oh, they still do. Bodnar: In what ways did they help? For example, let's say during a funeral or weddings or hard times."
"Brazina: Well, you done whatever you could to help the family. Like, say the neighbor died here ((the neighbor here?)). The first thing, my wife would go and get a ham or some kiboshe or so on, and send it up.. If there was small children, you'd help take care of the smaller children. Everybody helped. It's getting away from that somewhat today because when there was a funeral before, you'd have 20, 25 cars, Everybody'd take a day off around the family. Today even the family don't take a day off. You see one car in a funeral procession, where years ago the whole family took the time off. And they buried them from the house, which was charitable.They was 3 days and 3 nights that nobody slept, ate or washed, or anything else because the house was full of people. But now they go to the funeral parlor, and that's all over with."
"Bodnar: That's right. Funerals were held in the homes in this area, weren't they, for a long time?"
"Brazina: Oh yeah, couple fellows buried right out of here."
"Bodnar: The home we're in now, was this your mother's home?"
Brazina: My uncle's. Bodnar: When did you eventually come into this home?
Brazina: 1947.
"Bodnar: We'll that later, that comes a little bit later. When you're in the twenties - we're still back in the twenties - are you a member of the UMW at this time?"
Brazina: About that time.
Bodnar: What is the local you're in?
"Brazina: Avondale Local 1069, I believe the number.was at that time. You don't remember, but Avondale was the predominant local,"
Bodnar: That's just south of here?
Brazina: Yeah
"Bodnar: I talked to a lot of men in Nanticare and Glenlyon. They’ve talked a lot about some of the union politics. Many of them expressed some bitterness, they felt that many of the local union officials were too close to the mine owners and not enough interested in the needs of the men themselves. Would you say that that was somewhat true at Avondale?"
"Brazina: Well that happened, I got a story, about-the-paper for you. I got a piece in here. Ì was part of that. I was president of Avondale union, but we started a new union at that time [1934]. I went the union meeting and asked about getting some aid. We had then 8, children, were working 2, 3 days a week. So, I asked if we couldn't get some aid from the district office. The president of the union at that time, district president, was John Boylan. His salary was $15,000 a year, at that time. So, I went to the meeting, and asked if some of the members couldn't get aid. In the meantime, someone had dynamited Boylan's home. So when our representatives from our local went to the convention or whatever, semi-convention, they came back with a report that they couldn't get any aid for the members but they voted to pay for repairing Boiling's home and offer so much reward for the capture of the dynamiters. This really threw everybody in an uproar and, said, the hell with them, so there was a convention called by a fellow by the name of Tom Maloney and Cappalainey follow, one-armed fellow. He was very fiery Italian union leader here. He called a convention and we thought it was just sort of to try and straighten our outfit out, but instead of that they went off to a new direction. They went to what they called a new union. That was in ‘35, ‘36, and that's when all the turmoil was."
Bodnar: Going back to your local at Avondale. When did you run for president?
"Brazina: Not under United Mine Workers, I didn't. Under the new union, I was elected,"
Bodnar: You ran under the United Anthracite Miners.
Brazina: That's right.
"Bodnar: Were you dissatisfied with the district UMY, or were you also dissatisfied with the local at Avondale as well? For example, who were the leaders at Avondale?"
"Brazina: Well, there was John C _______ , there was a fellow Joe Brazina, and there was a fellow John Brazina - they weren't relatives of mine, same name. They weren't that bad, but their hands were tied because there wasn't much they could do."
Bodnar: There wasn't much they could do about what?
"Brazina: Well, to alleviate conditions, you know what I mean. The contract was theirs, it was paid for crops, it was paid for every third crop, it wasn't paid for every crop. It was paid for every third crop, the same as sheet iron. When you had a place going up with sheet iron, they said the lent. Well, maybe you'd have to put 2 lents in side by side, but they only considered one lent. The wording of the contract was nit-pick right through, and it was always a constant fight about what they'd pay for and what they wouldn't."
Bodnar: A fight with who?
"Brazina: The officials, the bosses. Some bosses would pay and some wouldn't, it all depended on how far they wanted to go. And, maybe sometimes their superior wouldn't let them go any further."
"Bodnar: If a man was a head of a local, would he tend to get a better job in the mines?"
"Brazina: Lots of times, yes."
"Bodnar: Describe to me, what would be a better job?"
"Brazina: If he was helping call the company work, like go along and fix track, and he'd put up props or timber where it was needed. But, there was no set amount of work he had to do, so if he didn't feel good that day, he could go in and sleep all day, and nobody bothered him."
"Bodnar: And he'd still be paid? Brazina: And he'd still be paid, sure. Bodnar: On company work, would that mean you would draw a salary?"
"Brazina: You was paid so much an hour a day, and your pay was assured. It wasn't like the contract miner, who had to get his cars and load them to get paid. Company work, you was assured your pay, it was like 6, 7 dollars a day, whatever. You was assured that, regardless of what you did or what you didn't do."
Bodnar: Were you a contract miner?
"Brazina: No. I worked in transportation mostly, running and drove mules and so on. Loaded coal very little. I worked company work, but very little. No, I have my mining papers, but I never mined to ________ money."
"Bodnar: If you were on company work, then you were also assured your pay, right?"
Brazina: Oh yes.
Bodnar: Why then did you become particularly dissatisfied with the local officials? You were assured of your pay. Was your work being cut back now-in-the-early thirties?
