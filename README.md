# OralHistories

This repository contains the text files for interviews from the Scranton Oral History Project. These oral histories are also on file at the [Pennsylvania State Archives](phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/mg/mg409.htm). 

Data analysis methods use the tidy text approach outlined by Silge and Robinson ([2017](https://www.tidytextmining.com/index.html)).
